- **Weight:** Drow weigh around 100 lb (75 + 2d6 Ã— 1d6 lb).

## Traits

- **Trance**: Elves don't need to sleep, but meditate semiconsciously, for 4 hours a day. This gives the same benefit as a human gets from 8 hours of sleep (long rest takes only 4 hours).
- **Sunlight Sensitivity**: Disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when I or what I am trying to attack/perceive is in direct sunlight.
