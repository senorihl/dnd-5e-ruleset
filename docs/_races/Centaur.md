**Scores:** +2 Strength, +1 Wisdom

## General information

- **Age:** Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.
- **Height:** Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers (6'0" + 1d10").
- **Weight:** Centaurs weigh around 670 lb (600 + 1d10 Ã— 2d12 lb).

## Traits

- **Fey**: My creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
- **Hooves**: I can use my hooves for unarmed strikes that deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage.
- **Charge**: If I move 30 ft straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, I can make a hooves attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Equine Build**: I count as one size larger for my carrying capacity and the weight I can push, drag, or lift. Because of my hooves, 1 ft of movement while climbing costs me 4 ft.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, Sylvan
