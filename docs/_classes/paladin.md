# Paladin

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 30), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 82)</small>

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 13 and Charisma 13
- **Hit dice**: d10

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple, martial
- **Armors:** light, medium, heavy, shields

## Equipment


Paladin starting equipment:

- A martial weapon and a shield -or- two martial weapons;
- Five javelins -or- any simple melee weapon;
- A priest's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- Chain mail and a holy symbol.

Alternatively, choose 5d4 × 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Divine Sense <small>(at level 1)</small>


As an action, I sense celestials/fiends/undead/consecrated/desecrated within 60 ft

Until the end of my next turn, I sense the type/location if it is not behind total cover



### Lay on Hands <small>(at level 1)</small>


As an action, I can use points in my pool to heal a touched, living creature's hit points

I can neutralize poisons/diseases instead at a cost of 5 points per affliction



### Fighting Style <small>(at level 2)</small>


Choose a Fighting Style for the paladin using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Defense Fighting Style**: 
   +1 bonus to AC when I'm wearing armor
- **Dueling Fighting Style**: 
   +2 to damage rolls when wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons
- **Great Weapon Fighting Style**: 
   Reroll 1 or 2 on damage if wielding two-handed/versatile melee weapon in both hands
- **Protection Fighting Style**: 
   As a reaction, I can give disadv. on an attack made vs. someone within 5 ft of me
   I need to be wielding a shield and be able to see the attacker to do this
- **Blind Fighting Style**: 
   I have blindsight with 10 ft range, allowing me to see anything not behind total cover
   In range, I can see invisible, but not hidden, things, even when blinded or in darkness
- **Interception Fighting Style**: 
   As a reaction when a creature I can see hits another within 5 ft of me, I can intercept
   I reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + my Proficiency Bonus (min 0 damage)
   I can't be the target and it requires me wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon
- **Blessed Warrior Fighting Style**: 
   I learn two cleric cantrips that count as paladin spells for me and use Cha for spellcasting
   Whenever I gain a paladin level, I can swap one of these for another cleric cantrip






### Spellcasting <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can cast prepared paladin spells, using Charisma as my spellcasting ability

I can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for my paladin spells



### Divine Smite <small>(at level 2)</small>


When I hit a melee weapon attack, I can expend a spell slot to do +2d8 radiant damage

This increases by +1d8 for each spell slot level above 1st and +1d8 against undead/fiends



### Channel Divinity <small>(at level 3)</small>




### Sacred Oath <small>(at level 3)</small>


Choose a Sacred Oath you swear to and put it in the "Class" field on the first page

Choose Oath of the Ancients, Crown, Devotion, Vengeance, or become an Oathbreaker



### Divine Health <small>(at level 3)</small>


I am immune to disease, thanks to the power of my faith



### Aura of Protection <small>(at level 6)</small>


While I'm conscious, allies within range and I can add my Cha mod (min 1) to saves



### Aura of Courage <small>(at level 10)</small>


While I'm conscious, allies within range and I can't be frightened



### Improved Divine Smite <small>(at level 11)</small>


Whenever I hit a creature with a melee weapon, I do an extra 1d8 radiant damage



### Cleansing Touch <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can end one spell on me or another willing creature by touch
