- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 13
- **Hit dice**: d8

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple
- **Armors:** light

## Equipment


Warlock starting equipment:

- A light crossbow and 20 bolts -or- any simple weapon;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- a dungeoneer's pack;
- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 × 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Pact Magic <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can cast warlock cantrips/spells that I know, using Charisma as my spellcasting ability

I can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for my warlock spells

I regain these spell slots on a short rest



### Otherworldly Patron <small>(at level 1)</small>


Choose the Otherworldly Patron you have a bargain with and put it in the "Class" field

Choose either the Archfey, the Fiend, the Great Old One, or the Undying



### Eldritch Invocations <small>(at level 2)</small>


Use the "Choose Feature" button above to add Eldritch Invocations to the third page

Whenever I gain a warlock level, I can replace an invocation I know with another



### Pact Boon <small>(at level 3)</small>


Choose a Pact Boon (Blade, Chain, or Tome) using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Pact of the Blade**: 
   As an action, I can create a pact weapon in my empty hand; I'm proficient in its use
   I can choose the type of melee weapon every time I create it, and it has those statistics
   The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 ft away from me for 1 minute
   The weapon counts as magical; I can transform a magic weapon into my pact weapon
   This occurs over an hour-long ritual that I can perform during a short rest
   I can use an action to re-summon it in any form and can dismiss it as no action
- **Pact of the Chain**: 
   I can cast Find Familiar as a ritual and it can be a Pseudodragon, Imp, Quasit, or Sprite
   When taking the attack action, I can forgo 1 attack to have my familiar attack instead
   It makes this 1 attack by using its reaction
- **Pact of the Tome**: 
   I have a Book of Shadows with any three cantrips of my choosing
   I can cast these cantrips as long as I have the book on my person
   Regardless of the lists they come from, these count as warlock cantrips to me
   I can get a replacement book with a 1-hour ceremony during a short or long rest
- **Pact of the Talisman**: 
   When the wearer of this amulet fails an ability check, they can add +1d4 to the roll
   I can give the talisman to others to use; The talisman turns to ash when I die
   If I lose my talisman, I can preform an 1-hour ceremony to gain a replacement
   This ceremony destroys the previous amulet and can be done during a short or long rest






### Mystic Arcanum <small>(at level 11)</small>


I can choose one spell from the warlock spell list of each level mentioned above

I can cast these spells each once per long rest without needing to use a spell slot



### Eldritch Master <small>(at level 20)</small>


I can regain all used pact magic spells slots by spending 1 minute entreating my patron
