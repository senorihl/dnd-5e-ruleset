> Inside the cube, the intangible spirits do all the following before vanishing:
> - Restore up to 100 HP, divided among the creatures in the cube as I choose
> - Repair all damaged objects entirely in the cube instantly
> - End every spell of 6th-level or lower on objects or creatures of my choice in the cube
> 
> I can do this once per long rest, or by expending 7 sorcery points (7 SP)
