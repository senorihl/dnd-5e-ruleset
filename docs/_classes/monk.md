## Equipment


Monk starting equipment:

- A shortsword -or- any simple weapon;

Alternatively, choose 5d4 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Unarmored Defense <small>(at level 1)</small>


Without armor and no shield, my AC is 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier



### Martial Arts <small>(at level 1)</small>


Monk weapons: any simple melee (not two-handed/heavy), unarmed strike, shortsword

With monk weapons, I can use Dex instead of Str and use the Martial Arts damage die

When taking an Attack action with these, I get one unarmed strike as a bonus action



### Ki <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can spend ki points to fuel special actions (see third page)

I need to meditate for at least 30 min of a short rest for that short rest to restore ki



### Unarmored Movement <small>(at level 2)</small>


Speed increases and eventually lets me traverse some surfaces without falling as I move



### Monastic Tradition <small>(at level 3)</small>


Choose a Monastic Tradition to commit to and put it in the "Class" field on page 1

Choose either Way of the Four Elements, Long Death, Open Hand, Shadow, or Sun Soul



### Deflect Missiles <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a reaction, I can reduce ranged weapon attack damage done to me

If the damage is negated, I catch and may throw it back (20/60 ft) as a monk weapon



### Slow Fall <small>(at level 4)</small>


As a reaction, I can reduce any falling damage I take by five times my monk level



### Ki-Empowered Strikes <small>(at level 6)</small>


My unarmed strikes count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities



### Evasion <small>(at level 7)</small>


My Dexterity saves vs. areas of effect negate damage on success and halve it on failure



### Stillness of Mind <small>(at level 7)</small>


As an action, I can end one effect on me that causes me to be charmed or frightened



### Purity of Body <small>(at level 10)</small>


[I am immune to poison and disease]



### Tongue of the Sun and Moon <small>(at level 13)</small>


I can understand all spoken languages and all creatures with a language understand me



### Diamond Soul <small>(at level 14)</small>


I am proficient with all saves; I can reroll a failed save once by spending 1 ki point



### Timeless Body <small>(at level 15)</small>


I don't require food or water; I don't suffer age penalties and can't be aged magically



### Empty Body <small>(at level 18)</small>


Be invisible and resist non-force damage for 1 min or cast Astral Projection on self



### Perfect Self <small>(at level 20)</small>


I regain 4 ki points if I have no more remaining when I roll initiative
