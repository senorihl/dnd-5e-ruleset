- **Prerequisites**: Wisdom 13
- **Hit dice**: d8

## Proficiencies

- **Tools:** Herbalism kit
- **Weapons:** club, dagger, dart, javelin, mace, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, sling, spear
- **Armors:** light, medium, shields

## Equipment


Druid starting equipment:

- A wooden shield -or- any simple weapon;
- A scimitar -or- any simple melee weapon;
- Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus.

Alternatively, choose 2d4 × 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Druidic <small>(at level 1)</small>


I know Druidic; Hidden messages with it can only be understood by who know Druidic



### Spellcasting <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can cast prepared druid cantrips/spells, using Wisdom as my spellcasting ability

I can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for my druid spells

I can cast my prepared druid spells as rituals if they have the ritual tag



### Druid Circle <small>(at level 2)</small>


Choose a Circle you can identify with and put it in the "Class" field on the first page

Choose either the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon



### Wild Shape <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I assume the shape of a beast I have seen before with the following rules:
- I gain all its game statistics except Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
- I get its skill/saving throw prof. while keeping my own, using whichever is higher
- I assume the beast's HP and HD; I get mine back when I revert back
- I can't cast spells in beast form, but transforming doesn't break concentration
- I retain features from class, race, etc., but I don't retain special senses
- I can choose whether equipment falls to the ground, merges, or stays worn
- I revert if out of time or unconscious; if KOd by damage, excess damage carries over



### Timeless Body <small>(at level 18)</small>


I age more slowly, only 1 year for every 10 years that pass



### Beast Spells <small>(at level 18)</small>


I can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells while in a beast shape



### Archdruid <small>(at level 20)</small>


I can use Wild Shape an unlimited number of times

My druid spells don't require verbal, somatic, or free material components
