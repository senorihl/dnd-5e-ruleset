## Features

### Sidekick <small>(at level 1)</small>


Unlike other classes, a sidekick has preset ability scores and skill proficiencies

A sidekick gains 2 HD at 1st level, but doesn't get max HP for its 1st level

If the DM allows it, a race can be selected and have its racial traits applied

A sidekick does not get the benefits of a background, nor can it take feats or multiclass

Choose the magical role of the sidekick, mage or healer, and put it in the "Class" field

I add my spellcasting ability modifier to the damage I deal with any cantrip



### Empowered Spells <small>(at level 10)</small>
