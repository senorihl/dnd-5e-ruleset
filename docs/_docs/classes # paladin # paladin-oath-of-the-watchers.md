## Features

### Channel Divinity: Watcher's Will <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, Cha mod of creatures I see in 30 ft adv. on Int/Wis/Cha saves for 1 min



### Channel Divinity: Abjure the Extraplanar <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, all aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend in 30 ft must make Wis save

Succeeds if it can't hear me; On fail, turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage

Turned: move away, never within 30 ft of me, no reactions or actions other than Dash

Turned: may Dodge instead of Dash when nowhere to move and unable to escape bonds



### Aura of the Sentinel <small>(at level 7)</small>


If I'm not incapacitated, chosen creatures in range and I add my Prof. Bonus to Initiative



### Vigilant Rebuke <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when I or another I can see succeeds a Int, Wis, or Cha save, I can rebuke

The creature that forced the saving throw takes 2d8 + my Charisma mod force damage



### Mortal Bulwark <small>(at level 20)</small>


As a bonus action, I can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- Truesight 120 ft; Adv. on attacks vs. aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends
- When I hit and damage a creature with an attack, I can banish it if it fails a Cha save

It's banished to its native plane if not there now; It's immune for 24 hours on a success

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 5th-level or higher spell slot (SS 5+)
