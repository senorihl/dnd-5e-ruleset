# Fireball

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 144), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 241)</small>


3rd level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 150 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A tiny ball of bat guana and sulfur)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

   The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
