## Feature: Simic Researcher


I know where or from whom I can acquire scientific facts, usually from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes an Izzet facility, library, university, independent scholar, or creature. I might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets. The DM can rule that the knowledge is inaccessible place, can't be found, or requires a quest.

| 4 | I assume that everyone needs even the most basic concepts explained to them. |
| 5 | I describe everything that happens as if it were going into my research notes (and it often is). |
| 6 | I am insatiably curious about the seemingly infinite forms and adaptations of life. |
| 7 | I can't resist prying into anything forbidden, since it must be terribly interesting. |
| 8 | I employ a highly technical vocabulary to avoid imprecision and ambiguity in my communication. |

| 1 | I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere ... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me. |
| 2 | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica. |
| 3 | The other researchers in my clade are my family—a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species. |
| 4 | The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me. |
| 5 | I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation. |
| 6 | Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden. |
| 2 | I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters. |
| 3 | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions. |
| 4 | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger. |
| 5 | I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance. |
| 6 | I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete. |
