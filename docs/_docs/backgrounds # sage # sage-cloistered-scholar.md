## Feature: Library Access


I have free access to most of the library I work at, though it might have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access. I have a working knowledge of my cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and I know how to navigate those connections. I am likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries.
