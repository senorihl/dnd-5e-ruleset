# Spike Growth

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 182), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 277)</small>


2nd level transmutation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 150 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (Seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Duration:** Conc, 10 min

**Classes:** [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Ranger](/classes/ranger/)

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

   The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
