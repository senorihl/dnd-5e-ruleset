Cantrip transmutation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A short piece of copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 rnd

**Classes:** [Artificer](/classes/artificer/), [Bard](/classes/bard/), [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

   You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
