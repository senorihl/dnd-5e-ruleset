### Swarmkeeper Magic <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn Mage Hand; When cast, its hand takes the form of my swarming nature spirits

I get bonus spells known, which do not count against the number of spells I can know



### Writhing Tide <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a bonus action, I can fly on my swarm for 1 minute: 10 ft flying speed and can hover



### Mighty Swarm <small>(at level 11)</small>


[improves Gathered Swarm, see above]

Now 1d8 damage, knocks prone on failed save, or grants me half cover until next turn



### Swarming Dispersal <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when I take damage, I can gain resistance to that damage and teleport

I vanish into my swarm and teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 ft that I can see
