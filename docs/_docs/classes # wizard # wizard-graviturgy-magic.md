# Graviturgy Magic

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/wildemount">Explorer's Guide to Wildemount</a> (p. 185)</small>

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A spellbook.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Adjust Density <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can magically double or halve the weight of a creature I can see in 30 ft

If doubled, it has -10 ft speed and disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saves

If halved, it has +10 ft speed, can jump twice as far, and disadv. on Str checks and saves

This lasts for 1 minute or until my concentration ends (like concentrating on a spell)



### Gravity Well <small>(at level 6)</small>


Whenever I cast a spell on a creature, I can move it 5 ft to an empty space of my choice

This only works if the target is willing, fails its save vs. the spell, or the spell attack hits it



### Violent Attraction <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction when I or a creature I see in 60 ft hits a weapon attack, I can improve it

I increase the weapon's velocity, causing it to deal an extra 1d10 damage

As a reaction if a creature within 60 ft is damaged by a fall, I can increase it by 2d10



### Event Horizon <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can magically emit powerful gravitational magic that pulls on hostiles

Whenever a creature hostile to me starts it turn within 30 ft, it must make Str save

If failed, it takes 2d10 force damage and its speed is 0 until the start of its next turn

If successful, it takes half the damage and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet

This lasts for 1 minute or until my concentration ends (like concentrating on a spell)

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 3rd-level or higher spell slot (SS 3+)
