## Features

### Draconic Gift <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn the Draconic language and the Thaumaturgy cantrip



### Drake Companion <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, I can summon my drake to appear in an empty space within 30 ft

Select a "Drake Companion" on the companion page for its stats and rules

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 1st-level or higher spell slot (SS 1+)



### Bond of Fang and Scale <small>(at level 7)</small>


My drake is now Medium, can serve as a mount, and has either 40 ft fly or swim speed

If I choose swimming, it can also breathe underwater; It can't fly with a rider on its back

The drake's bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage chosen by its Draconic Essense

While it is summoned, I gain resistance to the damage type of its Draconic Essense



### Drake's Breath <small>(at level 11)</small>


As an action, I can cause my drake or myself to exhale a 30-ft cone breath weapon

Its damage type is acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison; Dex save to halve the damage

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 3rd-level or higher spell slot (SS 3+)



### Perfected Bond <small>(at level 15)</small>


My drake is now Large and its bite deals +1d6 damage chosen by its Draconic Essence

As a reaction when the drake or I take damage while within 30 ft of each other,

I can give myself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage
