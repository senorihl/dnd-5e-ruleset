# Chaos Bolt

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 151), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/guildmasters-guide-ravnica">Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica</a> (p. 67)</small>


1st level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V,S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/)

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

d8	Damage Type

  1	Acid

  2	Cold

  3	Fire

  4	Force

  5	Lightning

  6	Poison

  7	Psychic

  8	Thunder

   If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

   A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
