<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 155), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/player%E2%80%99s-companion">Elemental Evil Player's Companion</a> (p. 17)</small>


3rd level transmutation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A piece of obsidian)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.
