## Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool


A member of the Golden Grin will find me and give shelter to me and my companions if I play the Ballad of the Grinning Fool in a major tavern or inn in a large city. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide me. I must use the ballad with caution, for those who know the ballad can be traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.
