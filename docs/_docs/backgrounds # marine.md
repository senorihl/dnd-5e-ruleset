## Feature: Steady


I can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march and need to make Constitution saves at the end of each extra hour to avoid gaining a level of exhaustion. Additionally, I can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.
