# Wild Magic

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 103)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Sorcerer starting equipment:

- A light crossbow and 20 bolts -or- any simple weapon;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A dungeoneer's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- Two daggers.

Alternatively, choose 3d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Wild Magic Surge <small>(at level 1)</small>


Wild Magic Surges can happen 5% of the time that I cast a sorcerer spell

This doesn't happen with cantrips and I only take this chance if the DM tells me to

Metamagic can't affect spells cast because of the surge, but they require no concentration

See the "Notes" page for the table



### Tides of Chaos <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can gain advantage on either one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw

After I cast a 1st-level or higher sorcerer spell, the DM can impose a Wild Magic Surge

After I roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, I regain my use of Tides of Chaos



### Bend Luck <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, I can add/subtract 1d4 from another's attack roll, ability check, or save



### Controlled Chaos <small>(at level 14)</small>


Whenever I roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, I can roll twice and use either result



### Spell Bombardment <small>(at level 18)</small>


Once per turn, when I roll spell damage, I can take one damage die that rolled max

I can then roll this die again and add it to the spell's damage
