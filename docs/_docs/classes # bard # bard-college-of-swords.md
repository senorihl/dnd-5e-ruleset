## Features

### Bonus Proficiencies <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with medium armor and scimitars

My bardic spellcasting focus can be any simple or martial weapon I'm proficient with



### Fighting Style <small>(at level 3)</small>


Select a Fighting Style for the college of swords using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Dueling Fighting Style**: 
   +2 to damage rolls when wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons
- **Two-Weapon Fighting Style**: 
   I can add my ability modifier to the damage of my off-hand attacks






### Blade Flourish <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I take the Attack action on my turn, I gain bonus speed and special attack options

I gain +10 ft to my walking speed until the end of the current turn

Once per turn when I hit with a weapon attack, I can expend a Bardic Inspiration die

The roll of that die is added to the weapon's damage, in addition to one of the following:
- Defensive Flourish: the result is also added to my AC until the start of my next turn
- Slashing Flourish: the extra damage is also dealt to any of my choosing in 5 ft of me
- Mobile Flourish: the target is also pushed 5 plus the die result in feet away from me

As a reaction after this push, I can move my speed to a space within 5 ft of the target



### Master Flourish <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I do a Blade Flourish, I can use a d6 instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die
