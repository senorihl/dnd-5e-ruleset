## Features

### Battle Ready & Tool Proficiency <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with martial weapons and smith's tools

I can use my Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for magic weapons



### Steel Defender <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I end a long rest, I can use smith's tools to create a steel defender

I determine its appearance; It obeys my commands and it acts on my initiative, after me

Unless I use a bonus action to command it, it only takes the Dodge action on its turn

It can take reactions and move on its turn even if I don't command it

I can't have multiple at once; Select "Steel Defender" on a companion page for its stats



### Arcane Jolt <small>(at level 9)</small>
