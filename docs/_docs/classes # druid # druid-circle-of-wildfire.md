## Features

### Circle Spells <small>(at level 2)</small>


My link to a wildfire spirit grants me access to spells, which count as druid spells to me

These are always prepared, but don't count against the number of spells I can prepare



### Summon Wildfire Spirit <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can expend a use of wild shape to summon a wildfire spirit within 30 ft

All within 10 ft of where it manifests must make a Dex save or take 2d10 fire damage

It is friendly and obeys my commands; It lasts for 1 hour, until it has 0 HP, or I die

Unless I use a bonus action to command it, it only takes the Dodge action on its turn

It can always take reactions and move on its turn; It acts on my initiative, after me

It disappears if I summon another; See "Wildfire Spirit" on a companion page for its stats



### Enhanced Bond <small>(at level 6)</small>


While my wildfire spirit is present, I can have my spells originate from it (no range 'self')

Also, I can then add 1d8 to a single roll of my spells that restore HP or deal fire damage



### Cauterizing Flames <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction when a Small or larger creature dies within 30 ft of me or wildfire spirit,

I can have a spectral flame erupt in its space that lasts for 1 minute

As a reaction when I see a creature enter the flame's space, I can extinguish the flame

This heals or deals fire damage to the creature (my choice) equal to 2d10 + my Wis mod



### Blazing Revival <small>(at level 14)</small>


If I drop to 0 HP and don't die, and my wildfire spirit is within 120 ft, it can save me

I can have it drop to 0 HP; I then regain half my HP and immediately rise to my feet
