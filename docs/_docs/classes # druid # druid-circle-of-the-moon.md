## Features

### Circle Forms <small>(at level 2)</small>


I am able to transform into more dangerous animal forms when using Wild Shape



### Wild Shape <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action, I assume the shape of a beast I have seen before with these rules:
- I gain all its game statistics except Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
- I get its skill/saving throw prof. while keeping my own, using whichever is higher
- I assume the beast's HP and HD; I get mine back when I revert back
- I can't cast spells in beast form, but transforming doesn't break concentration
- I retain features from class, race, etc., but I don't retain special senses
- I can choose whether equipment falls to the ground, merges, or stays worn
- I revert if out of time or unconscious; if KOd by damage, excess damage carries over



### Combat Wild Shape <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action while in Wild Shape, I can expend spell slots to heal myself

I regain 1d8 HP per expended spell slot level; I can use Wild Shape as a bonus action



### Primal Strike <small>(at level 6)</small>


My attacks count as magical while in Wild Shape



### Elemental Wild Shape <small>(at level 10)</small>


I can transform into an air/earth/fire/water elemental by expending 2 Wild Shape uses



### Thousand Forms <small>(at level 14)</small>


I can cast Alter Self at will without using a spell slot
