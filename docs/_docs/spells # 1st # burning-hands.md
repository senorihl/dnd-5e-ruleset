# Burning Hands

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 123), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 220)</small>

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Self (15ft cone)

**Components:** V,S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

   The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
