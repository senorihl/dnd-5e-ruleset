## Feature: Legion Station


I am established in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion. I can requisition simple equipment for temporary use. I have access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica where I can rest in safety and have access to medics. I'm paid 1 gp per week (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin), allowing me (together with the free garrison lodging) to have a poor lifestyle between adventures.
