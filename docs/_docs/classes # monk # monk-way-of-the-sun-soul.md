Monk starting equipment:

## Features

### Radiant Sun Bolt <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain a ranged spell attack that I can use as an attack in the Attack action

If I do this and spend 1 ki point, I can make 2 of these attacks as a bonus action



### Searing Sunburst <small>(at level 11)</small>


As an action, anyone in a 20-ft radius light on a point within 150 ft makes a Con save

If failed and not behind opaque total cover, take 2d6 (+ 2d6/ki point) radiant damage



### Sun Shield <small>(at level 17)</small>


As a reaction, when I'm hit by a melee attack, I can deal 5 + Wis mod radiant damage

I can only do this while my light aura is on; I can turn it on/off as a bonus action
