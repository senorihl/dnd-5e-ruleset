<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 155), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/player%E2%80%99s-companion">Elemental Evil Player's Companion</a> (p. 17)</small>


1st level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 10 ft

**Components:** V,S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Bard](/classes/bard/), [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
