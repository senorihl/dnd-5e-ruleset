# School of Necromancy

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 118)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A spellbook.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 × 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Necromancy Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy necromancy spells into my spellbook



### Grim Harvest <small>(at level 2)</small>


Once per turn, when I kill something with a 1st-level or higher spell, I regain hit points

The number of hit points regained is 2× the spell's level (or 3× with necromancy spells)

This doesn't occur for constructs/undead



### Undead Thralls <small>(at level 6)</small>


I add Animate Dead to my spellbook and can have an additional target when casting it

Undead created by my necromancy spells have the following benefits:

They add my proficiency bonus to damage and my wizard level to their HP maximums



### Inured to Undead <small>(at level 10)</small>


I have resistance to necrotic damage and my hit point maximum can't be reduced



### Command Undead <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, an undead within 60 ft that I can see must make a Charisma save

If its Int is > 7, it has adv. on the save; If its Int is > 11, it repeats the save every hour

If failed, it becomes friendly to me and obeys my commands until I use this on another

On success, it becomes permanently immune to my further attempts
