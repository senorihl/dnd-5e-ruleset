### Warrior of the Gods <small>(at level 3)</small>


Spells restoring me to life (not undeath or anything else) don't require material comp.



### Fanatical Focus <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I fail a saving throw while raging, I can reroll it and must use the new roll

I can use this ability only once per rage



### Zealous Presence <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a bonus action, I choose up to 10 creatures within 60 ft that can hear my battle cry

These creatures gain adv. on attacks and saves until the start of my next turn



### Rage Beyond Death <small>(at level 14)</small>


While raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock me unconscious

I still must make death saves, and I suffer the normal effects of taking damage

I only die due to failed death saves if my rage ends while I'm at 0 HP
