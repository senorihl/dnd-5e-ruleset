# Destructive Wave

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 231)</small>

5th level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Self (30-ft rad)

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Paladin](/classes/paladin/)

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
