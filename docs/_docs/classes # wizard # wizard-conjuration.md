## Features

### Conjuration Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy conjuration spells into my spellbook



### Minor Conjuration <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can conjure an object up to 3 ft on each side and no more than 10 lbs

It must be of a form of a nonmagical object I have seen and is created within 10 ft

The object disappears after 1 hour, if it takes or deals damage, or when I use this again



### Benign Transposition <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can teleport to a place within 30 ft that I can see

Instead, I can swap places with a willing Small/Medium creature in 30 ft that I can see

I can do this again after a long rest or casting a 1st-level or higher conjuration spell



### Focused Conjuration <small>(at level 10)</small>


While I am concentrating on a conjuration spell, it can't be broken by taking damage



### Durable Summons <small>(at level 14)</small>


Any creature I summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points
