## Features

### Master of Intrigue <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with disguise kits, forgery kits, one gaming set, and two languages

I can mimic speech patterns and accents if I've heard them for at least 1 minute



### Master of Tactics <small>(at level 3)</small>


I can use the Help action as a bonus action

This even works if the ally attacks a target within 30 ft of me that can see or hear me



### Insightful Manipulator <small>(at level 9)</small>


By spending 1 minute observing/interacting outside of combat I can learn capabilities

The DM tells me if the target is my equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two things:
- Intelligence score    - Wisdom score    - Charisma score    - Class levels (if any)



### Misdirection <small>(at level 13)</small>


As a reaction, I can redirect an attack meant for me to a creature within 5 ft of me

This only works if the creature is providing me with cover against the attack



### Soul of Deceit <small>(at level 17)</small>


My thoughts can't be read by telepathy or similar means; I can project false thoughts

For that, I must pass a Cha (Deception) vs. Wis (Insight) check to fool the mind reader

Magic always determines I'm truthful; I can't be magically compelled to tell the truth
