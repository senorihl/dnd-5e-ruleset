# Silence

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 179), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 275)</small>


2nd level illusion

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V,S 

**Duration:** Conc, 10 min

**Classes:** [Bard](/classes/bard/), [Cleric](/classes/cleric/), [Ranger](/classes/ranger/)

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
