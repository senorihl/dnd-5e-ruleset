Artificer starting equipment:

Alternatively, choose 5d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Magical Tinkering <small>(at level 1)</small>


As an action, I use thieves/artisan's tools to give 1 property to a nonmagical tiny object:
- Emit light (5-ft radius bright light, equal dim), an odor, or a nonverbal sound
- Static visual effect on one surface, or emit a 6-second recorded message when tapped

If I instill a property in more objects than I can have active, the oldest loses its property



### Spellcasting <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can cast prepared artificer cantrips/spells, using Intelligence as my spellcasting ability

To cast, I must use thieves' or artisan's tools I'm proficient with as a spellcasting focus

I can cast my prepared artificer spells as rituals if they have the ritual tag

Whenever I gain an artificer level, I can swap one artificer cantrip I know for another



### Infuse Item <small>(at level 2)</small>


Use the "Choose Feature" button above to add Artificer Infusions to the third page



### The Right Tool for the Job <small>(at level 3)</small>


In 1 hour (during a rest) I can create a set of artisan's tools that last until I do so again



### Artificer Specialist <small>(at level 3)</small>


Choose a specialism and put it in the "Class" field on the first page

Choose either alchemist, artillerist, or battle smith



### Tool Expertise <small>(at level 6)</small>


[expertise with all tools I'm proficient with]



### Flash of Genius <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a reaction when I or another in 30 ft make a check/save, I can add my Int mod to it



### Magic Item Adept <small>(at level 10)</small>


It takes me half the normal time and gold to craft common and uncommon magic items



### Spell-Storing Item <small>(at level 11)</small>


When I finish a long rest, I can infuse a 1st-/2nd-level artificer spell into an item I touch

It has to be a weapon or spellcasting focus for me; Stored spells are lost if I do this again

The spell must have a casting time of 1 action, but I need not have it prepared

A creature holding an infused item can use an action to cast the spell, using my abilities



### Magic Item Savant <small>(at level 14)</small>


[ignore class/race/spell/level attune require.]



### Soul of Artifice <small>(at level 20)</small>


[+1 on all saves per attuned magic item]

As a reaction when I'm reduced to 0 HP, I can end one infusion to drop to 1 HP instead
