## Features

### Tools Proficiency <small>(at level 3)</small>


[proficient with woodcarver's tools]



### Eldritch Cannon <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, I can use woodcarver's or smith's tools to create an eldritch cannon in 5 ft

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a spell slot (SS 1+) to create one cannon

I decide its size (Small/Tiny), appearance, type: flamethrower, force ballista, or protector

It disappears after 1 hour, when reduced to 0 HP, or if I dismiss it as an action

As a bonus action when within 60 ft of it, I can activate it to move and do its action

I can't have multiple cannons; Select "Eldritch Cannon" on a companion page for its stats



### Arcane Firearm <small>(at level 5)</small>


[lasts until I use this feature again]

After a long rest, I can use woodcarver's tools to enhance a wand, staff, or rod

If I use this as my spellcasting focus for an artificer spell, I add +1d8 to one damage



### Explosive Cannon <small>(at level 9)</small>


My eldritch cannons deal +1d8 damage; As an action, I can detonate a cannon in 60 ft



### Fortified Position <small>(at level 15)</small>


[cannons grant half cover in 10 ft to allies]

I can now have two cannons at the same time and activate both with one bonus action

I can create 2 eldritch cannons with the same action (still only one with a spell slot)
