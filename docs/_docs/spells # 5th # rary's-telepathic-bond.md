5th level divination

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 30 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)

**Duration:** 1 h

**Classes:** [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.

   Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.
