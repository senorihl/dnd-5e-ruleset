<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 4), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 23)</small>

**Scores:** +2 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence

## General information

- **Age:** High elves typically claim adulthood around age 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
- **Height:** High elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall (4'6" + 2d10").
- **Weight:** High elves weigh around 115 lb (90 + 2d10 Ã— 1d4 lb).

## Traits

- **Trance**: Elves don't need to sleep, but meditate semiconsciously, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, I can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, I gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep, thus needing only 4 hours for a long rest.
- **Cantrip**: I know one cantrip of my choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is my spellcasting ability for it.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, Elvish, 1 of your choice
- **Weapons:** longsword, shortsword, longbow, shortbow
