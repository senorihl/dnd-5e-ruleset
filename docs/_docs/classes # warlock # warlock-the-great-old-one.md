## Features

### Awakened Mind <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can telepathically speak to creatures I can see within 30 ft if they know a language



### Entropic Ward <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, when I'm attacked, I can impose disadvantage to that attack roll

If it misses me, I have adv. on my next attack vs. the attacker during my next turn



### Thought Shield <small>(at level 10)</small>


No one can read my mind unless I allow it; I have resistance to psychic damage

When I take psychic damage, the dealer of the psychic damage takes the same amount



### Create Thrall <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can charm an incapacitated humanoid by touch

While it is charmed, I can communicate with it telepathically if it is on the same plane

This lasts until the charm is removed (can be by Remove Curse) or I use this again
