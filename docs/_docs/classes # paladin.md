Until the end of my next turn, I sense the type/location if it is not behind total cover

   Reroll 1 or 2 on damage if wielding two-handed/versatile melee weapon in both hands

   As a reaction, I can give disadv. on an attack made vs. someone within 5 ft of me
   I need to be wielding a shield and be able to see the attacker to do this

   I learn two cleric cantrips that count as paladin spells for me and use Cha for spellcasting
   Whenever I gain a paladin level, I can swap one of these for another cleric cantrip
