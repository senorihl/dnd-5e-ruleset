## Feature: Mercenary Life


I know the mercenary life well. I am able to identify mercenary company emblems, and I know a little about any such company, including the leaders, reputation, and who hired them recently. I can find the locales where mercenaries abide anywhere, as long as I speak the language. My mercenary work between adventures affords me a comfortable lifestyle.
