## Features

### Ranger's Companion or a Variant <small>(at level 3)</small>


Select Ranger's Companion or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Ranger's Companion**: 
   It adds my proficiency bonus to AC, attacks, damage, and save/skill proficiencies
   Its hit point maximum equals four times my ranger level if higher than its normal HP
   It takes a turn on my initiative; It takes the Dodge action unless I command it otherwise
   As an action, I can have it take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn
   I can still use Extra Attack while commanding it to Attack; No action to order to move
- **Primal Companion**: 
   When I finish a long rest, I can summon a primal beast of the land, sea, or sky in 5 ft
   I determine what animal it looks like, but it always has primal markings
   It is friendly to me and my allies, obeys my commands, and acts during my turn
   Unless I use a bonus action to command it, it only takes the Dodge action on its turn
   I can also forgo one attack of my Attack action to command it to take the Attack action
   It can take reactions and move on its turn even if I don't command it
   As an action within 1 hour of it dying, I can touch it and expend a spell slot to revive it
   It then returns to full HP in 1 minute; It vanishes if I summon another one or if I die






### Exceptional Training <small>(at level 7)</small>


My beast's attacks count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities

As a bonus action, I can command it to take the Dash/Disengage/Help action on its turn



### Bestial Fury <small>(at level 11)</small>


When I command my beast to use the Attack action, it can attack twice on its turn



### Share Spells <small>(at level 15)</small>


When I cast a spell on myself, I can have it also affect my beast if it is within 30 ft
