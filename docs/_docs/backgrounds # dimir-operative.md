## Feature: False Guild Identity


I have more than one identity. The one I wear most of the time makes me appear to be a member of a guild other than my own. I have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow me to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild. Whenever I choose, I can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.
