## Features

### Mote of Potential <small>(at level 3)</small>


Those who use my Bardic Inspiration die gain an extra bonus depending how they use it:
- Ability check: Roll the die twice and choose which result to use
- Attack roll: the target and others of my choice I can see in 5 ft must make a Con save

If failed, they take the die roll in thunder damage; This uses my spell save DC
- Saving throw: Grants temporary HP equal to the roll + my Cha mod (min 1 temp HP)

### Animating Performance <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can animate a Large or smaller nonmagical item I can see within 30 ft

It is friendly and obeys my commands; It lasts for 1 hour, until it has 0 HP, or I die

Unless I use a bonus action to command it, it only takes the Dodge action on its turn

It can take reactions and move on its turn without commands; I can't have multiple

When I use bardic inspiration, I can command the item as part of the same bonus action

It acts on my initiative, after me; See "Dancing Item" on a companion page for its stats

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 3rd-level or higher spell slot (SS 3+)



### Creative Crescendo <small>(at level 14)</small>
