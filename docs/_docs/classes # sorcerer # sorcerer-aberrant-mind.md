Sorcerer starting equipment:

## Features

### Psionic Spells <small>(at level 1)</small>


I learn additional spells, which do not count towards the number of spell I can know

Whenever I gain a sorcerer level, I can replace one of these with another of the same level

It must be a divination or enchantment spell on the sorcerer, wizard, or warlock spell list



### Telepathic Speech <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a bonus action, I can telepathic link myself with a creature within 30 ft that I can see

If we share a language, we can talk telepathically while in my Cha mod of miles (min 1)

This last for my level in minutes, until I'm incapacitated, I die, or I use this feature again



### Psionic Sorcery <small>(at level 6)</small>


I can expend sorcery points instead of a spell slot to cast a spell from my Psionic Spells

This costs the spell's level in sorcery points, but in doing so requires no other components

However, I do need to provide a material components if it is consumed by the spell



### Psychic Defenses <small>(at level 6)</small>


I gain resistance to psychic damage and adv. on saves vs. being charmed or frightened



### Revelation in Flesh <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a bonus action, I can expend 1 or more sorcery points to transform for 10 minutes

For each sorcery point used, I gain one of the following benefits of my choice:
- I can see any invisible creatures within 60 ft of me not behind total cover
- I gain a flying speed equal to my walking speed and I can hover
- I gain a swimming speed equal to twice my walking speed & I can breathe underwater
- I can move, with equipment, through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing

Also, I can spend 5 ft of movement to escape form a grapple or nonmagical restraints



### Warping Implosion <small>(at level 18)</small>


As an action, I can teleport to an unoccupied space I can see within 120 ft

All within 30 ft of where I left take 3d10 force damage and must make a Strength save

If failed, each is pulled towards the space I left, ending up in the nearest empty space

If successful, a creature takes only half damage and isn't pulled

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending 5 sorcery points (5 SP)
