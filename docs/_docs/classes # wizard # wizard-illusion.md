# School of Illusion

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 118)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A spellbook.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Illusion Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy illusion spells into my spellbook



### Improved Minor Illusion <small>(at level 2)</small>


I gain the knowledge of the Minor Illusion cantrip (or another if I already knew it)

When I cast it, I can create both a sound and an image with a single casting



### Malleable Illusion <small>(at level 6)</small>


After I cast an illusion spell that lasts 1 min or longer, I can use an action to change it



### Illusory Self <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction, when I'm attacked, I can impose an illusion that makes the attack miss



### Illusory Reality <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a bonus action, after I cast a 1st-level or higher illusion spell, I can make it real

One inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion becomes real for 1 minute

The object can't be something that directly harms someone
