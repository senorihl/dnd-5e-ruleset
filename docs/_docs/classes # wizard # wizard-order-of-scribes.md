## Features

### Wizardly Quill <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action, I can magically create a Tiny quill with the following properties:
- It doesn't require ink and produces ink in the color of my choice when writing with it
- I require only 2 minutes per spell level to transcribe spells into my spellbook with it
- As a bonus action, I can use it to erase a text written with it if within 5 ft of the text

The quill disappear if I create another or if I die



### Awakened Spellbook <small>(at level 2)</small>


My spellbook gains sentience and grants me the following benefits while I am holding it:
- I can use the book as a spellcasting focus for my wizard spells
- When I cast a wizard spell using a spell slot, I can temporarily replace its damage type

The new type must appear in my spellbook in a spell of the same level as the spell slot
- Once per long rest, I can ritual cast a wizard spell without 10 min extra casting time

I can replace it over a short rest, transferring its spells and sentience to a blank book



### Manifest Mind <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a bonus action, I can have the mind of my awakened spellbook manifest within 60 ft

The spellbook needs to be on my person to do this; The mind is a Tiny spectral object

The mind is intangible, doesn't occupy a space, hovers, and sheds dim light in 10 ft

It can hear, see, has 60 ft darkvision, and telepathically shares with me what it perceives

As a bonus action, I can dismiss it or move it up to 30 ft to an empty space I can see

It can pass through creatures; It stops manifesting if it's over 300 ft from me or I die

It also stop manifesting if Dispel Magic is cast on it or the awakened spellbook is no more

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a spell slot (SS 1+) to manifest it again



### Manifest Mind: Cast Spell <small>(at level 6)</small>


I can have wizard spells I cast on my turn originate from the mind while its manifested



### Master Scrivener <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I finish a long rest, I can write a spell in my awakened spellbook on a blank paper

It must be a level 1 or 2 spell with 1 action casting time; My spellbook must be in 5 ft

As an action, I can use this scroll to cast the spell on it at one higher level than normal

Only I can use the scroll; The scroll turns blank again when I use it or finish a long rest

Also, using my Wizardly Quill, the gold and time I need to craft spell scrolls is halved



### One with the Word <small>(at level 14)</small>
