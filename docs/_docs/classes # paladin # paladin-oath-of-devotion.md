## Features

### Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, for 1 minute, I add my Cha modifier to hit for one weapon I'm holding

It also counts as magical and emits bright light in a 20-ft radius and equal dim light



### Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, all fiends/undead within 30 ft that can hear me must make a Wis save

If one of them fails this save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage

Turned: move away, never within 30 ft of me, no reactions or actions other than Dash

Turned: may Dodge instead of Dash when nowhere to move and unable to escape bonds



### Aura of Devotion <small>(at level 7)</small>


While I'm conscious, allies within range and I can't be charmed



### Purity of Spirit <small>(at level 15)</small>


I am always under the effect of a Protection from Evil and Good spell



### Holy Nimbus <small>(at level 20)</small>


As an action, I shine with a 30-ft radius bright light and equal dim light for 1 minute

If an enemy starts its turn in the bright light, it takes 10 radiant damage

For the duration, I have advantage on saves vs. spells cast by fiends and undead
