## Feature: Legalese


My experience with the local legal system has given me a firm knowledge of its ins and outs. Even when the law is not on my side, I can use complex terms like "ex injuria jus non oritur" to frighten people into thinking I know what I'm talking about. I might be able to intimidate or deceive folks who don't know any better to get favors or special treatment.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I can't believe I have a chance to join Acquisitions Incorporated! The fun I'm going to have! |
| 2 | I've been wronged my entire life, and the world owes me. |
| 3 | I have always tried to make the best of a bad situation. |
| 4 | The law doesn't protect the honest and the hard working. I'm going to do whatever needs to be done to make things right. |
| 5 | I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time. |
| 6 | My superiors are smarter and wiser than I am. I do what I'm told. |
| 7 | Never pass up the opportunity to make an easy bit of coin. That's my motto. |
| 8 | I'm beginning to feel like the gods are not on my side. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Justice**. Those who break the law need to answer for their crimes. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Freedom**. People must have the freedom to do what they want and pursue their dreams. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | **Greed**. Everyone I see is getting theirs, so I'm surely going to get mine. (Evil) |
| 4 | **Chaos**. You're out of order! And you're out of order! This whole realm is out of order! (Chaotic) |
| 5 | **Humility**. I'm just a small part of a larger whole. So is everyone else. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Responsibility**. We all have our roles to play. I'll hold up my end of the bargain. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Others hurt in the same accident that hurt me are my new family. I'll make sure they're taken care of. |
| 2 | The rulers of this place were kind to me, and they have my lifelong devotion. |
| 3 | My parents worry about me, but I'll make them proud. |
| 4 | The only bond that matters is the one holding my money pouch to my belt. |
| 5 | The other new hires at Acquisitions Incorporated are my allies. We have each other's backs. |
| 6 | My legal counsel is my best friend. I owe all my forthcoming opportunities to their hard work. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The person who gains the most reward for the least effort wins. |
| 2 | Three magic beans for just one cow? What a deal! |
| 3 | I have only one vice, but it controls my life. |
| 4 | Sleep is for the weak. We need to keep training more if we're going to be ready for the challenges ahead. |
| 5 | Until my songs are sung in every tavern in this realm, I won't be satisfied. |
| 6 | If people find me unpleasant, that's their problem. |
