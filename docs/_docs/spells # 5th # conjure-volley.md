# Conjure Volley

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 226)</small>

5th level conjuration

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 150 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (One piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Ranger](/classes/ranger/)

You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius. 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.
