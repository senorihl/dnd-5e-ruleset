## Traits

- **Deathless Nature**: I don't need to sleep, eat, drink, or breathe. I have adv. on saves vs. disease, poison, and death saves. I have resistance to poison damage. Magic can't put me to sleep and I can finish a long rest in 4 hours if I spend it in an inactive, motionless state.
- **Knowledge from a Past Life**: When I make an ability check that uses a skill, I can add +1d6 to the roll after seeing the d20 result. I can do this a number of times equal to my Proficiency Bonus and regain all expended uses when I finish a long rest.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, 1 of your choice
