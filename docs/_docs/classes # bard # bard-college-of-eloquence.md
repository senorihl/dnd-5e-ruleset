## Features

### Silver Tongue <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I make a Persuasion or Deception check, I can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10



### Unsettling Words <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I expend a Bardic Inspiration use & choose a target I can see in 60 ft

It subtracts my inspiration die from the next save it makes before my next turn starts



### Unfailing Inspiration <small>(at level 6)</small>


When a creature adds my Bardic Inspiration die to a roll but fails, they can keep the die



### Universal Speech <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can choose up to my Charisma modifier (min 1) creatures within 60 ft

Those creatures magically understand any language I speak for an hour

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 1st-level or higher spell slot (SS 1+)



### Infectious Inspiration <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a reaction when a creature uses my inspiration die and succeeds, I can inspire another

I give a creature within 60 ft that can hear me an inspiration die without expending any
