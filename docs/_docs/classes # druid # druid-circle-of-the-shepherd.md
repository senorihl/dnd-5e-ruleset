## Features

### Speech of the Woods <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can talk with beasts, they understand me and I them, to the limit of their intelligence

This doesn't automatically make me friends with all beasts; Additionally, I learn Sylvan



### Spirit Totem <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action, I can summon, or move, a spirit to a point I can see within 60 ft

It is a spectral form of a Bear, Hawk, or Unicorn (my choice), with a 30-ft radius aura

It is incorporeal, immobile, doesn't counts as a creature or object, and persists for 1 min

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until I'm incapacitated
- Bear: my allies and I, if in the aura, immediately gain 5 + my druid level in temp HP

While in the aura, my allies and I gain advantage on Strength checks and saves
- Hawk: As a reaction, I can grant advantage on an attack vs. a target in the aura

While in the aura, my allies and I gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
- Unicorn: my allies and I gain advantage on ability checks to detect targets in the aura

When I cast a healing spell with a spell slot, allies in the aura heal my druid level in HP



### Mighty Summoner <small>(at level 6)</small>


Beasts or Fey I summon with spells get +2 HP per HD and their attacks count as magical



### Guardian Spirit <small>(at level 10)</small>


When a Beast or Fey that I summoned ends its turn in my Spirit Totem aura, it heals



### Faithful Summons <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I am reduced to 0 HP or incapacitated against my will, I can cast Conjure Animals

This is done as if using a 9th-level spell slot to summon 4 beast of my choice up to CR 2

They appear within 20 ft of me, last 1 hour, and protect me from harm and attack foes
