<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 155), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 252)</small>


4th level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 300 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A pinch of dust and a few drops of water)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

   Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
