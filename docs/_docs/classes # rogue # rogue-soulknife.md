## Features

### Psionic Energy Dice <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain twice my proficiency bonus of psionic energy dice (PsiD) that fuel my psionics

I regain all expended psionic energy dice after a long rest; See psionic powers on page 3

As a bonus action once per short rest, I can regain one expended psionic energy die



### Psychic Blades <small>(at level 3)</small>


As part of an Attack action, I can manifest a psychic blade from a free hand to attack

It vanishes immediately after making the attack and leaves no mark on its target

As a bonus action after this attack, I can manifest and attack with another psychic blade

To do this, my other hand needs to be free as well and this blade does only 1d4 damage



### Soul Blades <small>(at level 9)</small>


My psi-suffused soul grants me more psionic powers, see the 3rd page's "Notes" section



### Psychic Veil <small>(at level 13)</small>


As an action, I can become invisible along with what I'm wearing or carrying for 1 hour

I can end it (no action); It also ends if I damage a creature or force one to make a save

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a psionic energy die (PsiD)



### Rend Mind <small>(at level 17)</small>


When I use my psychic blade to deal sneak attack damage to a target, I can have it save

It must make a Wisdom save (DC 8 + Prof. Bonus + Dex mod) or be stunned for 1 min

It can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns to end being stunned

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending three psionic energy dice (3 PsiD)
