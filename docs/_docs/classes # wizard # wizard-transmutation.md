# School of Transmutation

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 119)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A spellbook.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Transmutation Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy transmutation spells into my spellbook



### Minor Alchemy <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can transform an object of wood/stone/iron/copper/silver into another of those

For each 10 min I spend, I can transform up to 1 cubic foot of the material

It reverts back when I lose concentration or after 1 hour



### Transmuter's Stone <small>(at level 6)</small>


In 8 hours, I can create a transmuter's stone that gives its wielder one of the following:
- Darkvision 60 ft
- 10 ft increase to speed while unencumbered
- Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
- Resistance to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage

The benefit is chosen at creation; I can have only one active stone at a time

I can change the benefit when I cast a 1st-level or higher transmutation spell with it



### Shapechanger <small>(at level 10)</small>


I add Polymorph to my spellbook; I can cast it on myself without using a spell slot

When I do that, I can only transform into a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or lower



### Master Transmuter <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can destroy my transmuter's stone and do one of the four following:

1) Major Transformation

In 10 minutes, I transmute one nonmagical object up to 5 cubic foot into another

This new, nonmagical object must be of similar size and mass and equal or less value

2) Panacea

One touched has all curses, diseases, and poisons removed and is healed to max HP

3) Restore Life

I cast Raise Dead without using spell slots or needing to have it in my spellbook

4) Restore Youth

A touched creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years (to a minimum of 13)
