# School of Evocation

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 54), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 117)</small>

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A scholar's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A spellbook.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Evocation Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy evocation spells into my spellbook



### Sculpt Spells <small>(at level 2)</small>


If I cast an evocation spell affecting others I can see, I can protect 1 + the spell's level

The chosen automatically succeed on their saving throws vs. the spell

They also take no damage if the spell would normally deal half damage on a save



### Potent Cantrip <small>(at level 6)</small>


Any cantrips I cast still deal half damage on a successful save



### Empowered Evocation <small>(at level 10)</small>


I can add my Int modifier to a single damage roll of any wizard evocation spell I cast



### Overchannel <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I cast a 5th-level or lower wizard spell that damages, it can deal max damage

Except the first time I do this after a long rest, I suffer 2d12 necrotic dmg per spell lvl

Every time I do it after that, before a long rest, I take another 1d12 necrotic damage

This necrotic damage surpasses my resistances/immunities; I can't overchannel cantrips
