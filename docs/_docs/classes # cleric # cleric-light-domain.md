## Features

### Bonus Cantrip <small>(at level 1)</small>


I learn the Light cantrip if I didn't already know it



### Warding Flare <small>(at level 1)</small>


When a creature within 30 ft attacks me and I can see it, I can interpose divine light

As a reaction, I impose disadv. on the attacker's attack roll (unless it can't be blinded)



### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, in 30 ft, magical darkness is dispelled and hostiles must make a Con save

Each takes radiant damage, saves for half, and negates with total cover



### Improved Flare <small>(at level 6)</small>


I can also use my Warding Flare if another is attacked by a creature within 30 ft of me



### Potent Spellcasting or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Potent Spellcasting or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Potent Spellcasting**: 
   I can add my Wisdom modifier to the damage I deal with my cleric cantrips
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Corona of Light <small>(at level 17)</small>


As an action, I have an aura of 60 ft sunlight and 30 ft dim light for 1 min

Enemies in the sunlight have disadv. on saves vs. spells that deal fire or radiant damage
