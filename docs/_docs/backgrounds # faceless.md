## Feature: Dual Personalities


The world knows me as my persona and those who seek to learn more about me find themselves stymied by my disguise. I'm unidentifiable as my true self while disguised and behaving as my persona, allowing me to change appearances between my two personalities as I wish. My deception might lose its effectiveness if someone realize the connection.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'm earnest and uncommonly direct. |
| 2 | I strive to have no personality—it's easier to forget what's hardly there. |
| 3 | I treasure a memento of the person or instance that set me upon my path. |
| 4 | I sleep just as much as I need to and on an unusual schedule. |
| 5 | I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming. |
| 6 | I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length. |
| 7 | I am ever learning how to be among others—when to stay quiet, when to laugh. |
| 8 | I behave like an extreme opposite of my persona. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Justice**. Place in society shouldn't determine one's access to what is right. (Good) |
| 2 | **Security**. Doing what must be done can't bring the innocent to harm. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Confusion**. Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won't expect. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Infamy**. My name will be a malediction, a curse that fulfills my will. (Evil) |
| 5 | **Incorruptibility**. Be a symbol, and leave your flawed being behind. (Any) |
| 6 | **Anonymity**. It's my deeds that should be remembered, not their instrument. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe. |
| 2 | What I do, I do for the world. The people don't realize how much they need me. |
| 3 | I've seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has. |
| 4 | I stand in opposition, lest the wicked go unopposed. |
| 5 | I am exceptional. I do this because no one else can, and no one can stop me. |
| 6 | I do everything for those who were taken from me. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I am callous about death. It comes to us all eventually. |
| 2 | I never make eye contact or hold it unflinchingly. |
| 3 | I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing. |
| 4 | I overexert myself, sometimes needing to recuperate for a day or more. |
| 5 | I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming. |
| 6 | I see morality entirely in black and white. |
