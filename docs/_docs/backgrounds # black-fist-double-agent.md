## Feature: Double Agent


I have a trusty contact in the Tears of Virulence garrison in Phlan to whom I pass information. In exchange, I get away with minor criminal offenses in Phlan. My Black Fists contacts can help me get an audience with the Lord Regent, the Lord Sage, Black Fists members, or deposed nobles who are sympathetic to the Phlan refugees and insurgents.
