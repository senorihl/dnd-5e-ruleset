Wizard starting equipment:

## Features

### Enchantment Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy enchantment spells into my spellbook



### Hypnotic Gaze <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, a seen enemy within 5 ft must make a Wis save or be charmed

This doesn't work if it can't see/hear me; It's also incapacitated and reduced to 0 speed

This lasts until the end of my next turn, but I can use an action to extend the duration

It also ends if it takes damage, can't see or hear me, or is more than 5 ft from me

On success or once it ends, I can't use this on it again until after a long rest



### Instinctive Charm <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, when someone I can see in 30 ft attacks me, it must make a Wis save

If failed, it must instead attack the closest creature within range (not me or self)

On a success, the target is immune to this until after my long rest; This is a charm effect



### Split Enchantment <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I cast an enchantment spell with only one target, I can target a second in range

This does not apply to cantrips



### Alter Memories <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I cast an enchantment spell that charms, I can have one target be unaware of it

Also, once before that spell ends, I can have that target forget time while affected

It must make an Intelligence save or lose up to 1 + Charisma modifier hours of memory
