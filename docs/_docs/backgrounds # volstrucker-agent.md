# Volstrucker Agent

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/wildemount">Explorer's Guide to Wildemount</a> (p. 202)</small>

## Feature: Shadow Network


I can use the Volstrucker shadow network to communicate with other members over long distances. I can write a letter in special arcane ink (10 gp per page), address it to another member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire. It will burn and materialize whole again on the person of the addressee. This special ink is the same as used for a wizard's spellbook.

| 1 | I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself. |
| 2 | I indulge vice in excess to quiet my conscience. |
| 3 | I've left emotion behind me. I'm now perfectly placid. |

| 5 | I always keep my wordâ€”except when I'm commanded to break it. |
| 6 | I laugh off insults and never take them personally. |

| d6 | Ideal |

| 4 | **Determination**: I cannot fail. Not ever. (Neutral) |
| 5 | **Fear**: People should not respect power. They should fear it. (Evil) |

| d4 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The job is all that matters. I will see it through. |
| 2 | My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything. I would die for them. |
| 3 | Everything I've done, I've done to protect someone close to me. |
| 4 | If the empire falls, all of civilization falls with it. I will hold back chaos and barbarism at any cost. |

| 1 | I drink to dull the pain in the back of my head. |
| 2 | I go a bit mad when I see blood. |
| 3 | I can hear the voices of everyone I've killed. I see their faces. I can't be free of these ghosts. |
| 4 | Fear is a powerful motivator. I will do whatever it takes to prevent those who know what I am from seeing me fail, and from those I care about from knowing what I am. |
