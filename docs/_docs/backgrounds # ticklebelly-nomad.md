## Feature: At Home in the Wild


In the wilderness, my home, I can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate that is secure enough to conceal me from most natural threats, but not all supernatural, magical, or threats that actively seek me out. However, this feature doesn't shield or conceal me from scrying, mental probing, nor from threats that don't need the five senses to find me.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I eagerly inject myself into the unknown. |
| 2 | Villages, towns, and cities do not suit me. I'd rather be out in the wilderness any day. |
| 3 | I accomplish my tasks efficiently, using as few resources as possible. |
| 4 | It's difficult for me to remain in one place for long. |
| 5 | I loudly brag about my tribe every chance I get. |
| 6 | Having walked among giants, I am fearless in the face of bigger creatures. |
| 7 | I am quiet and reserved, but observant. Nothing escapes my attention. |
| 8 | My word is my bond. I see a promise to completion, even if it conflicts with my beliefs. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Kinship**: Family is most important in life. Though I may be far from my own, the bonds of family must be protected in others' lives as well. (Good) |
| 2 | **Preservation**: Nature must not be despoiled by encroaching civilization. (Any) |
| 3 | **Wanderlust**: One must expand their horizons by seeing the world and exploring. (Chaos) |
| 4 | **Isolation**: My tribe and its ways must be protected and shielded from outside influence. (Neutral) |
| 5 | **Protection**: Threats to the land and to the people must be dealt with at any and all costs. (Law) |
| 6 | **Belonging**: All creatures have a place in the world, so I strive to help others find theirs. (Good) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I ache to return to my tribe and the family I left, but cannot until my obligations are fulfilled. |
| 2 | The dragon cultists that invaded my homeland stole away one of my tribe's people. I will not know rest until I've found them. |
| 3 | The dragon's presence in the hills destroyed valuable territory and resulted in deaths within my tribe. The creature must pay for what it has done. |
| 4 | I carry a trinket that spiritually and emotionally ties me to my people and my home. |
| 5 | I discovered a strange relic in the hills during my tribe's wanderings. I must discover what it is. |
| 6 | One of the stone giant clans from the Giant's Cairn has graced me with a mark of kinship. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I throw myself and my friends into situations rarely ever thinking about consequences. |
| 2 | Unfamiliar people and surroundings put me on edge. |
| 3 | I have absolutely no patience for slowpokes and those who prove indecisive. |
| 4 | My desire to experience new things causes me to make unsafe choices. |
| 5 | I am overly protective of nature, sometimes to the detriment of my companions and myself. |
| 6 | My lack of worldliness often proves my undoing in social, commercial, and hostile situations. |
