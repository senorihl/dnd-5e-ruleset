## Features

### Fancy Footwork <small>(at level 3)</small>


Enemies I make a melee attack against in my turn can't use opportunity attacks on me

This lasts until the end of my current turn



### Rakish Audacity <small>(at level 3)</small>


I don't need advantage to sneak attack if my target is the only one within 5 ft of me

I still can't sneak attack if I have disadv.; I add my Charisma modifier to initiative rolls



### Panache <small>(at level 9)</small>


As an action, I can beguile a creature that hears and understands me, for 1 minute

It must succeed a Wis (Insight) check opposed by my Cha (Persuasion) or be affected as:
- A hostile target gains disadv. on attacks and can't do opportunity attacks vs. not-me

This effect ends if an ally attacks or casts a spell vs. it, or if it and I are 60 ft apart
- Targets that are not hostile are charmed and regard me as a friendly acquaintance

This effect ends if me or an ally do anything harmful to it



### Elegant Maneuver <small>(at level 13)</small>


As a bonus action, I can gain adv. on my next Dex (Acrobatics) or Str (Athletics) check



### Master Duelist <small>(at level 17)</small>


Once per short rest, when I miss with an attack roll, I can roll again with advantage
