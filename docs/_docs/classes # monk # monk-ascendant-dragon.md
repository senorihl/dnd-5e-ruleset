Monk starting equipment:

## Features

### Draconic Disciple <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of my choice

I can change the damage type of my unarmed strikes to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison

As a reaction when I fail an Intimidation or Persuasion check, I can reroll the check

If this reroll turns the check into a success, I can't do so again until I finish a long rest



### Wings Unfurled <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I use Step of the Wind, I can gain a flying speed equal to my walking speed



### Ascendant Aspect <small>(at level 17)</small>


I gain 10 ft blindsight and both Breath of the Dragon and Aspect of the Wyrm improve
