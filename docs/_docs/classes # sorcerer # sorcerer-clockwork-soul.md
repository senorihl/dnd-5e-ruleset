## Features

### Clockwork Magic <small>(at level 1)</small>


I learn additional spells, which do not count towards the number of spell I can know

Whenever I gain a sorcerer level, I can replace one of these with another of the same level

It must be an abjuration or transmutation spell on the sorcerer, wizard, or warlock list



### Restore Balance <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a reaction when a creature I can see in 60 ft is about to roll a d20 with adv./disadv.,

I can prevent that roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage



### Bulwark of Law <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can imbue a creature I can see within 30 ft with a magical ward

The ward has a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points I expend to do this

As a reaction when the creature takes damage, it can expend any number of those dice

The dice roll reduces the damage; The ward lasts until I finish a long rest or do this again



### Trance of Order <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a bonus action, I can enter a state of clockwork consciousness for 1 minute

While in this state, attack rolls against me can't benefit from advantage

Also, I can then treat a d20 roll below 9 as a 10 for my attack rolls, checks, and saves

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending 5 sorcery points (5 SP)



### Clockwork Cavalcade <small>(at level 18)</small>


As an action, I can call spirits to bring balance in a 30-ft cube originating from me

Inside the cube, the intangible spirits do all the following before vanishing:
- Restore up to 100 HP, divided among the creatures in the cube as I choose
- Repair all damaged objects entirely in the cube instantly
- End every spell of 6th-level or lower on objects or creatures of my choice in the cube

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending 7 sorcery points (7 SP)
