## Features

### Ancestral Protectors <small>(at level 3)</small>


While raging, the first creature I hit with an attack on my turn becomes distracted

While distracted, it has disadvantage on attack rolls that don't target me

In addition, everybody but me counts as having resistance to all of the target's attacks

This lasts until the start of my next turn, or until my rage ends



### Spirit Shield <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction while raging when an ally I see within 30 ft is damaged, I can reduce it

My guardian spirits reduce the damage by an amount equal to the roll of the dice



### Consult the Spirits <small>(at level 10)</small>


I can cast either Clairvoyance or Augury, without a spell slot or material components

Augury consults ancestral spirits; Clairvoyance summons an invisible ancestral spirit

Wisdom is my spellcasting ability for these spells



### Vengeful Ancestors <small>(at level 14)</small>


When using Spirit Shield, the attacker takes the reduced amount as force damage
