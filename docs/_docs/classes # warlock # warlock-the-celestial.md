## Features

### Bonus Cantrips <small>(at level 1)</small>


I learn the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips, not counting for the number I can know



### Healing Light <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a bonus action, I can heal a creature I can see within 60 ft by expending dice

I can expend up to my Charisma modifier (min 1) of dice from my pool at a time

The target heals HP equal to the roll of the dice; I regain all expended dice on a long rest



### Radiant Soul <small>(at level 6)</small>


I add my Cha modifier once to the fire or radiant damage of cantrips and spells I cast

This bonus only applies to one target; Also, I have resistance to radiant damage



### Celestial Resilience <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I finish a short or long rest, I and up to five allies gain temporary hit points

I get my warlock level + Cha mod, while my allies get half my warlock level + Cha mod



### Searing Vengeance <small>(at level 14)</small>


At the start of my turn when I would make a death save, I can instead spring back up

I recover HP equal to half my current HP maximum, and can then stand up if I choose

When I do, creatures of my choice within 30 ft take 2d8 + Cha mod in radiant damage

Damaged creatures are blinded until the end of my current turn
