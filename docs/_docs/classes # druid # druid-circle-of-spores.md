## Features

### Circle Spells <small>(at level 2)</small>


I learn the Chill Touch cantrip and gain the ability to cast certain spells

These are always prepared, but don't count against the number of spells I can prepare



### Halo of Spores <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a reaction when someone I can see in 10 ft starts its turn or moves, I can have it save

It must succeed on a Constitution save or take necrotic damage from my cloud of spores



### Symbiotic Entity <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can expend a Wild Shape use to boost my spores instead of transforming

I gain 4 temporary hit points per druid level and my Halo of Spores damage increases

Also, my melee weapon attacks do +1d6 necrotic damage with every hit

This lasts for 10 min, until these temporary HP run out, or until I use Wild Shape again



### Fungal Infestation <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction when a Small/Medium beast/humanoid dies in 10 ft, I can animate it

It rises as a zombie with 1 HP that follows my mental commands and dies after 1 hour

It can only take the attack action for one melee attack; It takes its turns after mine



### Spreading Spores <small>(at level 10)</small>


[only while Symbiotic Entity is active]

As a bonus action, I create a 10-ft cube of fungal spores within 30 ft, lasting for 1 min

Any creature moving into or starting its turn in it must save against my Halo of Spores

The cube ends if I use this feature again; While it persists, I can't use my Halo of Spores



### Fungal Body <small>(at level 14)</small>


I'm immune to being blinded, deafened, frightened, poisoned, and critical hits
