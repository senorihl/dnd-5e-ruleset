Monk starting equipment:

## Features

### Path of the Kensei <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with either calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies

Some weapons, that don't have the heavy or special property, are kensei weapons for me

At least one ranged and one melee weapon, more at higher levels (longbow does qualify)

With these: proficient, count as a monk weapons, special bonuses depending on type held:
- Melee: if I do unarmed strike during an Attack action, +2 AC until my next turn starts
- Ranged: as a bonus action, ranged weapon attacks deal +1d4 damage in current turn



### One with the Blade <small>(at level 6)</small>


My unarmed strikes and kensei weapon attacks count as magical



### Unerring Accuracy <small>(at level 17)</small>


Once per turn, if I miss a monk weapon attack on my turn, I can reroll the attack roll
