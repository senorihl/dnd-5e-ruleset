Paladin starting equipment:

## Features

### Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, a creature I can see within 10 ft must make a Str/Dex save (its choice)

If it fails this save, it is restrained until it succeeds on a save at the end of its turn



### Channel Divinity: Turn the Faithless <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, all fey/fiends within 30 ft that can hear me must make a Wisdom save

If one fails, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage and must show true form

Turned: move away, never within 30 ft of me, no reactions or actions other than Dash

Turned: may Dodge instead of Dash when nowhere to move and unable to escape bonds



### Aura of Warding <small>(at level 7)</small>


Allies within range and I have resistance to damage from spells



### Undying Sentinel <small>(at level 15)</small>


If dropped to 0 hit points and not killed outright, I can choose to stay at 1 hit point

Additionally, I suffer no drawbacks of old age and can't be aged magically



### Elder Champion <small>(at level 20)</small>


As an action, I assume the form of a force of nature for 1 minute and gain benefits:
- At the start of each of my turns, I regain 10 hit points
- I can cast paladin spells with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action instead
- Enemies within 10 ft have disadv. on saves vs. my paladin spells and channel divinity
