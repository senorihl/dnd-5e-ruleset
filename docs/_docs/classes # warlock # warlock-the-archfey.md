## Features

### Fey Presence <small>(at level 1)</small>


As an action, all creatures in a 10-ft cube around me must make a Wisdom save

If failed, they're all charmed or frightened (my choice) until the end of my next turn



### Misty Escape <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, when I take damage, I can turn invisible and teleport up to 60 ft

I stay invisible until the start of my next turn or until I attack or cast a spell



### Beguiling Defenses <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction, when a creature tries to charm me, I can turn the charm back on it

It must make a Wis save or be charmed by me for 1 minute or until taking damage

I am immune to being charmed



### Dark Delirium <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, a creature within 60 ft must make a Wis save or be charmed/frightened

This lasts for 1 minute or until my concentration is broken or it takes damage

During this time, it can't see or hear anything but the illusion, me, and itself
