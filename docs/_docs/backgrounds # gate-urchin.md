## Feature: Red Plume and Mage Guild Contacts


I made friends among the Red Plumes and Mage's Guild when I lived at the Hillsfar Gate. They remember me fondly and help me in little ways when they can. I can invoke their assistance in and around Hillsfar to obtain food, simple equipment for temporary use, and to gain access to the low-security areas of their garrisons, halls, and encampments.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I appreciate the simple things in life: a song, a warm meal, a sunny day. I don't need any more. |
| 2 | My problems are always caused by others. I'm never to blame. |
| 3 | I am afraid I could wind up back on the streets any day. |
| 4 | I get along with everyone. |
| 5 | I see people as marks for a con and have difficulty feeling true empathy for them. |
| 6 | I have a real flair for matchmaking. I can find anyone a spouse! |
| 7 | I think money is the true measure of appreciation and affection. Everything else is talk or an act. |
| 8 | I don't like having a lot of stuff, just a few simple things I need. I don't like being tied down and tend to leave things behind when I don't need them anymore. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Loyal**: I never rat out any of my friends, even when the Red Plumes or the Rogues Guild ask. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Adventurous**: I don't like doing the same thing every day. I crave variety. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | **Strong**: Only the strong survive. I respect those who are strong and powerful. (Any) |
| 4 | **Witty**: Brains are better than brawn. I rely on my wits and respect others who do the same. (Any) |
| 5 | **Honest**: Others can do what they want, but I won't lie or steal, even to feed my family. (Good) |
| 6 | **Ungrateful**: Those who give, only do it to make themselves feel better. I steal from them. (Evil) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The Joydancers of Lliira gave me my instrument when I really needed food. I hate them for that. |
| 2 | Busking has taught me to love music above all else. |
| 3 | The Rogues Guild spared me when I did a job without cutting them in. I owe them a great debt. |
| 4 | I know people hate the Red Plumes, but some of them were really good to me. I help Red Plumes whenever I can, and I respect them. They're just doing what they have to do to get by in this world. |
| 5 | I will be wealthy some day. My descendants will live in comfort and style. |
| 6 | I know how hard life on the streets is. I do everything I can for those who have less than me. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Though I no longer live at the Gate, I am still always concerned about where I will get my next meal. |
| 2 | Years of thieving have become habit. I sometimes steal from strangers without thinking about it. |
| 3 | I am ashamed of my origins. I pretend I am higher-born and fear others will find out the truth. |
| 4 | I think people who grew up in houses are soft, spoiled, and ungrateful. I frequently tell them so. |
| 5 | I am still very uncomfortable wearing nice clothes, sleeping in a warm bed, and eating fine food. |
| 6 | I do not trust anyone who has not had a hard life. |
