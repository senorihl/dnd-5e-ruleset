Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each non-hostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions - blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.
