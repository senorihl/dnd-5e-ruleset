## Feature: Criminal Contact

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong. |
| 2 | I am always calm, no matter the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me. |
| 3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable â€• or where such things could be hidden. |
| 4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. |
| 5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide. |
| 6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. |
| 7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. |
| 8 | I blow up at the slightest insult. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Honor**: I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Freedom**: Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | **Charity**: I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good) |
| 4 | **Greed**: I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil) |
| 5 | **People**: I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it. |
| 2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |

| 5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad. |
| 6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that. |
