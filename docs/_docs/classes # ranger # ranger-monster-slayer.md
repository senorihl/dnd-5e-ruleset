## Features

### Hunter's Sense <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, I learn vulnerabilities/immunities/resistances of a target I see within 60 ft

If it is protected from divination magic, I sense it has none of these



### Monster Slayer Magic <small>(at level 3)</small>


I get bonus spells known, which do not count against the number of spells I can know



### Slayer's Prey <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I designate a creature I see within 60 ft; This lasts until I do this again

My first hit to the target with a weapon attack on each of my turns does +1d6 damage



### Supernatural Defense <small>(at level 7)</small>


I add 1d6 to saving throws the current target of my Slayer's Prey forces me to make

In addition, I also add 1d6 to checks to escape that target's grapple



### Magic-User's Nemesis <small>(at level 11)</small>


As a reaction when I see someone within 60 ft casting a spell or teleporting, I can foil it

The target must make a Wisdom save or have its spell or teleport fail and be wasted



### Slayer's Counter <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when the target of my Slayer's Prey has me make a save, I can attack it

I can make one weapon attack; If this hits, I automatically succeed on the saving throw
