# Eladrin

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> (p. 286)</small>

## General information

- **Scores:** +2 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence
- **Age:** Eladrin typically claim adulthood around age 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

- **Weight:** Eladrin weigh around 115 lb (90 + 2d12 Ã— 1d4 lb).

## Traits

- **Trance**: Elves don't need to sleep, but meditate semiconsciously, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, I can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, I gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep, thus needing only 4 hours for a long rest.
- **Fey Step**: I can cast the Misty Step spell once using this trait. I regain the ability to do so when I finish a short rest.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, Elvish
- **Weapons:** longsword, shortsword, longbow, shortbow
