## Feature: Rubblebelt Refuge


I'm very familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: neighborhoods ruined by wurms, overgrown parks gone untended for decades, and the vast, long abandoned rubblebelts of broken terrain. There, I can find a suitable place for me and my allies to hide or rest, as well as food and fresh water for myself and up to five other people each day.
