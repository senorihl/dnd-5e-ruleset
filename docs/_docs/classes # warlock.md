- **Pact of the Blade**: 
   As an action, I can create a pact weapon in my empty hand; I'm proficient in its use
   I can choose the type of melee weapon every time I create it, and it has those statistics
   The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 ft away from me for 1 minute
   The weapon counts as magical; I can transform a magic weapon into my pact weapon
   This occurs over an hour-long ritual that I can perform during a short rest
   I can use an action to re-summon it in any form and can dismiss it as no action
- **Pact of the Chain**: 
   I can cast Find Familiar as a ritual and it can be a Pseudodragon, Imp, Quasit, or Sprite
   When taking the attack action, I can forgo 1 attack to have my familiar attack instead
   It makes this 1 attack by using its reaction
- **Pact of the Tome**: 
   I have a Book of Shadows with any three cantrips of my choosing
   I can cast these cantrips as long as I have the book on my person
   Regardless of the lists they come from, these count as warlock cantrips to me
