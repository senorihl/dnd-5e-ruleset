## Features

### Balm of the Summer Court <small>(at level 2)</small>


I have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to my druid level

As a bonus action, I can spend dice to heal an ally within 120 ft of me that I can see

I can spend up to half my druid level worth of dice from the pool at once

The ally heals an amount equal to the total rolled and gains 1 temp HP per die spent



### Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow <small>(at level 6)</small>


At the start of a rest, I can create a 30-ft radius invisible magical sphere

The sphere extends from a point in space I touch, but doesn't extend through total cover

Within this area, my allies and I gain +5 on Wis (Perception) and Dex (Stealth) checks

Also, any light from open flames that are in the sphere is invisible from outside the area

This effect lasts until the end of the rest or when I leave the sphere



### Hidden Paths <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a bonus action, I can teleport myself up to 60 ft to a spot I can see

As an action, I can teleport a willing ally I touch up to 30 ft to a spot I can see



### Walker in Dreams <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I finish a short rest, I can cast either Dream, Scrying, or Teleportation Circle

This doesn't require a spell slot or material components; Dream uses me as the messenger

Teleportation Circle connects to the last place I finished a long rest, if on the same plane
