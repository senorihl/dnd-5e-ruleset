## Features

### Channel Divinity: Peerless Athlete <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can get adv. on Str (Athletics) & Dex (Acrobatics) checks for 10 min

In that time, I also add +10 ft to jumps, and double what I can carry, push, drag, & lift



### Channel Divinity: Inspiring Smite <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action after dealing damage with Divine Smite, I can grant temporary HP

I distribute the temporary HP how I choose across creatures within 30 ft, including me



### Aura of Alacrity <small>(at level 7)</small>


If I'm not incapacitated, allies starting their turn in range gain bonus speed for that turn



### Glorious Defense <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when I or another in 10 ft is hit with an attack roll, I can grant bonus AC

I must be able to see the attacker; I add my Cha mod (min 1) to the AC for that attack

If it misses, I can do a weapon attack vs. the attacker, if in reach, as part of this reaction



### Living Legend <small>(at level 20)</small>


As a bonus action, I can empower myself with legends, gaining the following for 1 min:
- My otherworldly presence grants me advantage on Charisma checks
- Once on each of my turns when I miss with a weapon attack, I can have it hit instead
- As a reaction when I fail a saving throw, I can reroll it, but must use the new roll

I can do this once per long rest, or by expending a 5th-level or higher spell slot (SS 5+)
