I am immune to poison/disease and I can't be charmed/frightened by elementals or fey



### Nature's Sanctuary <small>(at level 14)</small>


When a beast or plant attacks me, it must make a Wis save or pick a different target

If it can't, it automatically misses; On a successful save, it is immune for 24 hours
