# Rime's Binding Ice

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/treasury-dragons">Fizban's Treasury of Dragons</a> (p. 21)</small>


2nd level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Self (30ft cone)

**Components:** S,M (A vial of meltwater)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
