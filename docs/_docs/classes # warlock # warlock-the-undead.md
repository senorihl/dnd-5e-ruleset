## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple
- **Armors:** light

Warlock starting equipment:

- A light crossbow and 20 bolts -or- any simple weapon;

- A scholar's pack -or- a dungeoneer's pack;
- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers.

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Form of Dread <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a bonus action, I can transform for 1 minute and gain the following benefits:
- I gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + my warlock level
- I am immune to the frightened condition
- Once per turns when I hit an attack, I can force the target to make a Wis save

If the target fails this save, it is frightened of me until the end of my next turn



### Grave Touched <small>(at level 3)</small>


I no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe

Once per turn if I damage a creature with an attack, I can change its type to necrotic

While I'm in my Form of Dread, I can roll one extra damage die for this necrotic damage



### Necrotic Husk <small>(at level 10)</small>


I have resistance to necrotic damage, or immunity while I'm in my Form of Dread

As a reaction when reduced to 0 HP, I can drop to 1 HP instead and erupt with energy

Each creature of my choice within 30 ft takes 2d10 + my warlock level necrotic damage

After this, I gain 1 level of exhaustion and must complete 1d4 long rests to do so again



### Spirit Projection <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can project my spirit from my body, leaving it suspended and unconscious

This lasts 1 hour or until my concentration is broken; Damage and effects affect both

When it ends, I can have my spirit return to my body or my body teleport to my spirit

My spirit has my abilities, but no gear; While projecting I gain the following benefits:
- My spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
- My conjuration/necromancy spells need no verbal, somatic, non-costly material comp.
- I gain a flying speed equal to my walking speed and can hover
- Move through creatures/objects as difficult terrain; 1d10 force damage if end turn in
- While in my Form of Dread, once per turns when I deal necrotic damage, I can heal

I regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt
