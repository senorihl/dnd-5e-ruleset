## Features

### Bonus Proficiencies <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with smith's tools and I learn to speak, read, and write Giant



### Rune Carver <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn how to use magic runes to enhance my gear that I can wear or hold in my hand

Use the "Choose Feature" button above to select a rune and add it to the third page

When I finish a long rest, I can inscribe each rune I know upon a different item I touch

Each item can hold only one rune and remains there until I finish a long rest

Runes inscribed on a carried object grant both a passive and a limited-use active effect

Whenever I gain a fighter level, I can swap a rune I know for another

The DC for a rune's abilities is 8 + my Proficiency bonus + my Constitution modifier



### Giant's Might <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can imbue myself with giant magic for 1 minute and gain benefits:
- Space permitted, I grow to a larger size category along with everything I'm wearing
- I have advantage on my Strength check and saves
- My weapon and unarmed strike attacks deal extra damage



### Runic Shield <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a reaction when I see a creature within 60 ft get hit by an attack, I can protect it

The attacker must reroll its attack roll and use the new roll



### Great Stature <small>(at level 10)</small>


My runes permanently make me grow; I add 3d4 inches to my length

In addition, the extra weapon damage I deal with Giant Might increases to 1d8



### Master of Runes <small>(at level 15)</small>


I can now invoke each of my runes twice per short rest instead of once



### Runic Juggernaut <small>(at level 18)</small>


Giant's Might now adds +1d10 weapon damage, and can make me grow up to Huge

While I'm Huge, my reach increases by 5 ft
