## Feature: Inheritance


The item I inherited has a special significance, history, power, and/or important value. When I begin my adventuring career, I can decide whether to tell my companions about it right away. Rather than attracting attention to myself, I could decide to keep it a secret until I learn more about what it means to me and what it can do for me.
