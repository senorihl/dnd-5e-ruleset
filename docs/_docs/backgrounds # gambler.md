## Feature: Never Tell Me the Odds


Odds and probability are my bread and butter. During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, I can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM's determination.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I plan for every contingency. Leave nothing to chance! |
| 2 | Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity. |
| 3 | I'm one of Lady Luck's favored. Anything I try is destined to succeed. |
| 4 | I've lost so much to gambling that I refuse to spend money on anything anymore. |
| 5 | Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward's act. |
| 6 | I can't be sure who I've swindled, cheated, or defeated, so I keep a low profile in public. |
| 7 | The perfect bet is out there somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open. |
| 8 | I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I'll be back at the card table. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Knowledge**. Knowledge is power, and knowing which horse to back is the key to success. (Any) |
| 2 | **Fate**. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Bravery**. If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Survival**. You can't win if you're dead. Live to fight another dayâ€”when the odds might be more in your favor. (Any) |
| 5 | **Reliability**. When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good) |
| 6 | **Victory**. Winning is the real measure of a person. In the end, the only thing that matters is the scoreboard. (Evil) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid. |
| 2 | I'm loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble. |
| 3 | The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I'm alive today. |
| 4 | A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash. |
| 5 | A criminal syndicate I once played for isn't happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me. |
| 6 | Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I'm driven to help them escape the streets. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to. |
| 2 | I save my sympathy for my friends, and I have no friends. |
| 3 | You think we're in trouble now? Let me tell you how bad things are likely to get! |
| 4 | You can loan me a little, right? I've got a sure thing. I'll double your money, guaranteed. |
| 5 | I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself. |
| 6 | I'm a great gambler. I'm just bad at math and logic. |
