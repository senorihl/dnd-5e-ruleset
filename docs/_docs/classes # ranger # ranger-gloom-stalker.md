## Features

### Dread Ambusher <small>(at level 3)</small>


I can add my Wisdom modifier to my initiative rolls

In the first turn of combat I get +10 ft speed and an extra attack with the Attack action

If I take the Attack action and that extra attack hits, it does +1d8 damage



### Gloom Stalker Magic <small>(at level 3)</small>


I add a spell to my known spells at level 3, 5, 9, 13, and 17

These count as ranger spells, but do not count against the number of spells I can know



### Umbral Sight <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain 60 ft darkvision, or add 30 ft to darkvision if I already had it because of my race

When I'm in darkness, others gain no benefit from darkvision to detect me



### Iron Mind <small>(at level 7)</small>


I gain proficiency with Wis saves, or if I'm already proficient, either Int or Cha saves



### Stalker's Flurry <small>(at level 11)</small>


Once on each of my turns when I miss a weapon attack, I can make an extra attack



### Shadowy Dodge <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when I'm attacked without adv., I can impose disadv. on the attack roll
