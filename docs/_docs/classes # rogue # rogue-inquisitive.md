## Features

### Ear for Deceit <small>(at level 3)</small>


For Wis (Insight) to sense if another is lying, I can treat a die roll of 7 or lower as an 8



### Eye for Detail <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can do either of the following:
- Make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object
- Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues



### Insightful Fighting <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can decipher the tactics of another I can see that's not incapacitated

I have to make a Wisdom (Insight) check vs. the target's Charisma (Deception) check

If I succeed, I can use my sneak attack on it even if I don't have adv. (but not if disadv.)

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until I successfully use Insightful Fighting again



### Steady Eye <small>(at level 9)</small>


I'm more perceptive when I don't move more than half my speed in the same turn

If so, I gain adv. on Wis (Perception) and Int (Investigation) checks during that turn



### Unerring Eye <small>(at level 13)</small>


As an action, I can sense magical deceptions within 30 feet of me, but not what it does

I learn the presence of illusions, shapechanged creatures, or magic designed to deceive



### Eye for Weakness <small>(at level 17)</small>


While my Insightful Fighting is active, I add 3d6 to sneak attacks against that target
