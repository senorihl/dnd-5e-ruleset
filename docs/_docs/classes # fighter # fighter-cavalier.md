#### Choices
- **Bonus Proficiency**: 
   I learn one language of my choice
- **Bonus Proficiency**: 
   I gain proficiency with Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion






### Born in the Saddle <small>(at level 3)</small>


I have advantage on saves to avoid falling off my mount, and land on my feet if I fail

Mounting or dismounting a creature costs me only 5 ft of movement instead of half



### Unwavering Mark <small>(at level 3)</small>


If I hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, I mark it until the end of my next turn

While it is within 5 ft of me, a marked target has disadv. on attacks not directed at me

If it damages anybody but me, I can make a special melee attack vs. it in my next turn

This takes a bonus action, but has adv. and adds half my fighter level to the damage

A mark ends early if I'm incapacitated, die, or somebody else marks the target



### Warding Maneuver <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a reaction when I or a creature within 5 ft is hit, I can try to fend off the strike

I add 1d8 to the target's AC; If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against it

I can only do this while wielding a melee weapon or a shield



### Hold the Line <small>(at level 10)</small>


Creatures provoke opportunity attacks when moving 5 ft or more while within my reach

If I hit an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn



### Ferocious Charger <small>(at level 15)</small>


If I hit a creature after moving 10 ft in a straight line, it must make a Strength save

If failed, the target is knocked prone; I can do this only once per turn



### Vigilant Defender <small>(at level 18)</small>


I can make opportunity attacks without using my reaction

I can do this only once on every creature's turn, except on my own turn

I can't do this on the same turn that I use my normal reaction
