3rd level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V,S,M (Niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)

**Duration:** Conc, 10 min

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell-and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter-you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
