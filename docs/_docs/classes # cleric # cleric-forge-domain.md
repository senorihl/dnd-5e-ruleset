## Features

### Bonus Proficiency <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools



### Blessing of the Forge <small>(at level 1)</small>


At the end of a long rest, I can imbue magic into a nonmagical weapon or armor

It becomes magical: +1 AC if armor, or +1 to attack and damage rolls if a weapon

This lasts until the end of my next long rest or until I die



### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing <small>(at level 2)</small>


With an hour-long ritual, I can craft a nonmagical item that is at least part metal

Including: suit of armor, simple or martial weapon, set of tools, 10 pieces of ammunition

The creation can be worth up to 100 gp, and I must expend metals of equal value to it

The metals irretrievably coalesce into the new item, forming even nonmetal parts of it

The item can be an exact duplicate of a nonmagical item if I possess the original

The item comes into existence at the end of the hour in an unoccupied space within 5 ft



### Soul of the Forge <small>(at level 6)</small>


I gain resistance to fire damage and +1 to AC while wearing medium or heavy armor



### Divine Strike or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Divine Strike or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Divine Strike**: 
   Once per turn, when I hit a creature with a weapon attack, I can do extra damage
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Saint of Forge and Fire <small>(at level 17)</small>


I gain immunity to fire damage

When wearing heavy armor, I'm resistant to nonmagical bludg./piercing/slashing damage
