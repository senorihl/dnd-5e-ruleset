- **Weapons:** simple, martial

Barbarian starting equipment:

- A greataxe -or- any martial melee weapon;

Alternatively, choose 2d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Magic Awareness <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, I can open my awareness to the presence of concentrated magic

Until my next turn ends, I know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 ft

I also learn the school of magic of a spell; This doesn't reveal anything behind total cover



### Wild Surge <small>(at level 3)</small>


Whenever I enter my rage, I roll on the Wild Magic table (see Notes page)



### Bolstering Magic <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can touch a creature or myself and confer one of the following benefits:
- For 10 minutes, they can add 1d3 to any attack roll and ability check
- Roll 1d3. They regain an expended spell slot of a level equal to or lower than the roll

A creature that receives the second benefit can't receive it again until after a long rest



### Unstable Backlash <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction in rage when taking damage or failing a save, I can lash out with magic

I roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately apply the roll, replacing my current effect



### Controlled Surge <small>(at level 14)</small>


Whenever I roll on the Wild Magic table, I can roll two dice and choose which to use

If I roll the same on both dice, I can instead choose any effect on the Wild Magic table
