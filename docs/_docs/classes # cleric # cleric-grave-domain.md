## Features

### Circle of Mortality <small>(at level 1)</small>


Spells I cast to heal a living creature at 0 HP have their dice count as their max result

I learn Spare the Dying, which I can cast as a bonus action with a range of 30 ft



### Eyes of the Grave <small>(at level 1)</small>


As an action, I sense undead within 60 ft that aren't protected from divination magic

Until the end of my next turn, I sense the location of any undead not behind total cover



### Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can curse a creature within 30 ft until the end of my next turn

It is vulnerable to all the damage from the next attack by me or my allies that hits it



### Sentinel at Death's Door <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, I turn a critical hit to me or an ally I see within 30 ft to a normal hit



### Potent Spellcasting or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Potent Spellcasting or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Potent Spellcasting**: 
   I add my Wisdom modifier to the damage I deal with my cleric cantrips
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Keeper of Souls <small>(at level 17)</small>


Once per round, if I'm not incapacitated, I can manipulate the energy of the dying

When an enemy I can see dies within 60 ft of me, I or an ally within 60 ft regain HP

The HP regained is equal to the enemy's number of Hit Dice
