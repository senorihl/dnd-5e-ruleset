## Features

### Bonus Proficiency <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain proficiency with heavy armor, and either the Intimidation or Persuasion skill



### Voice of Authority <small>(at level 1)</small>


Whenever I use a spell slot to cast a spell on an ally, it can use its reaction to attack

The ally makes one weapon attack against a target of my choice that I can see

If the spell targets multiple allies, I can choose which one can make the attack



### Channel Divinity: Order's Demand <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, all chosen targets in 30 ft that can see or hear me must make a Wis save

If failed, it is charmed by me until the end of my next turn or it takes any damage

Also, I can choose to have a charmed target drop what its holding when it fails its save



### Embodiment of the Law <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I cast an enchantment spell using a spell slot, I can reduce its casting time

If the spell normally has a casting time of an action, I can now cast it as a bonus action



### Divine Strike or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Divine Strike or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Divine Strike**: 
   Once per turn, when I hit a creature with a weapon attack, I can do extra damage
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Order's Wrath <small>(at level 17)</small>


If I deal my Divine Strike damage to a creature, it is cursed until my next turn starts

The next time it is hit by a weapon attack from my allies, it takes +2d8 psychic damage
