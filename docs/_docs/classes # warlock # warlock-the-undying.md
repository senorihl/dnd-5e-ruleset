## Features

### Among the Dead <small>(at level 1)</small>


I learn the Spare the Dying cantrip and gain advantage on saving throws vs. diseases

If an undead targets me directly with an attack or spell, it must make a Wisdom save

On a fail, it must choose a new target or forfeit its attack or harmful spell

On a success or if I attack or cast a harmful spell on it, it is immune for 24 hours



### Defy Death <small>(at level 6)</small>


I regain 1d8 + my Constitution modifier in HP when I succeed on a Death saving throw

I also regain this amount whenever I use Spare the Dying to stabilize a creature



### Undying Nature <small>(at level 10)</small>


I can hold my breath indefinitely; I don't require food, water, or sleep (I still need rest)

I age more slowly, only 1 year for every 10 years that pass; I can't be magically aged



### Indestructible Life <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a bonus action, I can regain HP and reattach severed body parts
