## Feature: Highborn


Mulmaster is run by and for its aristoracy. Every other class of citizen in the city defers to me, and even the priesthood, Soldiery, Hawks, and Cloaks treat me with deference. Other aristocrats and nobles accept me in their circles and likely know me or of me. My connections can get me the ear of a Zor or Zora under the right circumstances.

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have dedicated my wealth and my talents to the service of one of the city's many temples. |
| 2 | My family and I are loyal supporters of High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn. Our fortunes are inexorably tied to hers. I would do anything to support her. |
| 3 | Like many families who were close to High Blade Selfaril Uoumdolphin, mine has suffered greatly since his fall. We honor his memory in secret. |
| 4 | My family plotted with Rassendyll Uoumdolphin brother usurped brother as High Blade. Betrayal is the quickest route to power. |
| 5 | Wealth and power are nothing. Fulfillment can only be found in artistic expression. |
| 6 | It's not how you feel, who you know, or what you can do - it's how you look, and I look fabulous. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have difficulty caring about anyone or anything other than myself. |
| 2 | Having grown up with wealth, I am careless with my finances. I overspend and am overly generous. |
| 3 | The ends (my advancement) justify any means. |
| 4 | I must have what I want and will brook no delay. |
| 5 | My family has lost everything. I must keep up appearances, lest we become a laughingstock. |
| 6 | I have no artistic sense. I hide that fact behind extreme opinons and have become a trendsetter. |
