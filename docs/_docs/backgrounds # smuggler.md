## Feature: Down Low


I am acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help me out of tight spots. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community, my companions and I can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, I can choose to keep my presence (and that of my companions) a secret.
