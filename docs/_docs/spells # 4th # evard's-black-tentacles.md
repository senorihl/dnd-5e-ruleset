4th level conjuration

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 90 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)

**Duration:** Conc, 1 min

**Classes:** [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

   When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

   A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
