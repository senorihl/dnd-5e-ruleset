## Features

### Channel Divinity: Control Undead <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, one undead (CR < paladin level) I can see in 30 ft must make a Wis save

If failed, it must obey my commands for 24 hours or until I use this on another



### Channel Divinity: Dreadful Aspect <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, anyone I choose within 30 ft that can see me must make a Wisdom save

If failed, it is frightened for 1 min or until it succeeds a save at the end of its turns

It can't save at the end of its turn if it's still within 30 ft of me



### Aura of Hate <small>(at level 7)</small>


Fiends/undead within range and I add my Cha mod as bonus on melee weapon damage

Multiple Auras of Hate don't stack; only the strongest applies



### Supernatural Resistance <small>(at level 15)</small>


I have resistance to bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage from nonmagical weapons



### Dread Lord <small>(at level 20)</small>


As an action, I gain a 30-ft aura of gloom that reduces bright light to dim for 1 min

If frightened of me, foes starting their turn in the aura take 4d10 psychic damage

Attacks vs. my allies and me inside the aura have disadvantage if attackers need sight

As a bonus action, I can make a melee spell attack vs. a target inside the aura

If this attack hits, it does 3d10 + Charisma modifier necrotic damage
