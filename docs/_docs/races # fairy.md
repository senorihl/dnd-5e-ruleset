## Traits

- **Flight**: I have flying speed equal to my walking speed, but can't use it when wearing medium or heavy armor.
- **Fairy Magic**: I know the Druidcraft cantrip. At 3rd level, I can cast Faerie Fire and at 5th level I can cast Enlarge/Reduce. I can cast both spells without using a spell slot once per long rest each, as well as by using spell slots as normal. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is my spellcasting ability for these, chosen when I select the race.
