## Features

### Tentacle of the Deeps <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a bonus action, I can summon or move a spectral tentacle and make an attack with it

I can summon it to a space within 60 ft that I can see or move an existing one 30 ft

I make melee spell attacks with 10 ft reach with it that deal cold or lightning damage

Creatures hit by the tentacle suffer 10 ft speed reduction until the start of my next turn

The 10-ft long tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until I summon another



### Gift of the Sea <small>(at level 1)</small>


I have a swimming speed of 40 ft and I can breathe underwater



### Oceanic Soul <small>(at level 6)</small>


I gain resistance to cold damage now that I'm even more at home in the depths

While I'm fully submerged, others who are as well can understand my speech and I theirs



### Guardian Coil <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction when I or a creature I see in 10 ft of my tentacle is damaged, it can help

The tentacle interposes itself, reducing the damage of the attack for that creature



### Grasping Tentacles <small>(at level 10)</small>


I learn Evard's Black Tentacles; Once per long rest, I can cast it without using a spell slot

It counts as a warlock spell for me, but not towards the number of spell I can know

Whenever I cast it, I gain temporary hit points equal to my warlock level

Moreover, damage can't break my concentration on this spell



### Fathomless Plunge <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I can teleport myself and up to 5 willing creatures I can see within 30 ft

We reappear up to 1 mile away, inside or within 30 ft of a body of water I've seen
