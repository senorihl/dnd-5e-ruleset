## Features

### Sidekick <small>(at level 1)</small>


Unlike other classes, a sidekick has preset ability scores and skill proficiencies

A sidekick gains 2 HD at 1st level, but doesn't get max HP for its 1st level

If the DM allows it, a race can be selected and have its racial traits applied

A sidekick does not get the benefits of a background, nor can it multiclass



### Helpful <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can use a bonus action to take the Help action



### Cunning Action <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action



### Expertise <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain expertise with two skills I am proficient with



### Inspiring Help <small>(at level 7)</small>


When I use the Help action, the creature that receives the help adds +1d6 to its d20 roll

If it was an attack roll that hits without the +1d6, it can add it to the damage instead



### Evasion <small>(at level 7)</small>


My Dexterity saves vs. areas of effect negate damage on success and halve it on failure



### Reliable Talent <small>(at level 11)</small>


If I make an ability check where I add my proficiency bonus, rolls of 9 or lower are 10
