## Suggested Characteristics


| d6 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I love brewing up a new recipe, even if some might be repulsed by my choice of ingredients. Or the final product. Or both. |
| 2 | My fashion sense is like my garden: withered, black, and weird. |
| 3 | I'm going to befriend every single monster in this swamp if it's the last thing I do. |
| 4 | Everything in this world dies eventually. The question is, what will you do with the time you have left? |
| 5 | I know we just met, but when you die, may I have your bones? For research. |
| 6 | Don't interrupt me; I'm brooding. |
