## Features

### Spellcasting <small>(at level 1)</small>


I can cast prepared cleric cantrips/spells, using Wisdom as my spellcasting ability

I can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for my cleric spells

I can cast my prepared cleric spells as rituals if they have the ritual tag



### Divine Domain <small>(at level 1)</small>


Choose a Domain related to your deity and put it in the "Class" field on the first page

Choose either Arcana, Death, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War Domain



### Channel Divinity <small>(at level 2)</small>


I can channel divine energy to cause an effect; the save for this is my cleric spell DC



### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, all undead within 30 ft that can see/hear me must make a Wisdom save

If an undead fails this save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage

Turned: move away, never within 30 ft of me, no reactions or actions other than Dash

Turned: may Dodge instead of Dash when nowhere to move and unable to escape bonds



### Destroy Undead <small>(at level 5)</small>


An undead up to the CR above that fails its save when I use Turn Undead is destroyed



### Divine Intervention <small>(at level 10)</small>


As an action, I can implore my deity for help; the DM determines the form of help

Without intervention, I can retry after a long rest; otherwise, I have to wait a week
