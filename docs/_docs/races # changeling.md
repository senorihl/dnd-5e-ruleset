# Changeling

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/eberron">Eberron: Rising from the Last War</a> (p. 18)</small>

**Scores:** +2 Charisma

## General information

- **Age:** Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan, typically a century or less. While a changeling can transform to conceal their age, the effects of aging affect them similarly to humans.
- **Height:** Changelings stand between 5 and 6 feet tall (5'1" + 2d4").
- **Weight:** Changelings weigh around 140 lb (115 + 2d4 Ã— 2d4 lb).

## Traits

- **Shapechanger**: As an action, I can change my appearance and voice to or from a humanoid-shaped form I have seen, not changing my equipment. I determine the specifics of the form like hair length, eye color, and sex. I can adjust my height and weight, but not so much that my size changes. I revert back when I die. I can make myself appear as a member of another race, though none of my game statistics change.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, 2 of your choice
