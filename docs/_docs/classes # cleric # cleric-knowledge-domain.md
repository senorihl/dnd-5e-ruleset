As an action, I gain proficiency with a chosen skill or tool for 10 minutes



### Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, one creature within 60 ft I can see must make a Wisdom save

If it fails, I can read its surface thoughts for 1 min, as long as it's within 60 ft of me

As an action, I can end this and cast Suggestion on it (it fails its save automatically)

If it succeeded on its save, I can't use this feature again on it until I finish a long rest



### Potent Spellcasting or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Potent Spellcasting or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Potent Spellcasting**: 
   I can add my Wisdom modifier to the damage I deal with my cleric cantrips
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Visions of the Past <small>(at level 17)</small>


I can see recent events of an object or area by concentrating and praying for 1 min

I can meditate this way for up to a number of minutes equal to my Wisdom score
- Object Reading (after meditating for 1 minute per owner):

If an owner owned it in the last Wis score in days, I learn how that owner got/lost it

I also learn the most recent significant event involving the object and the owner
- Area Reading (my immediate surroundings, up to a 50-foot cube):

Going back my Wisdom score in days, per minute I meditate, I learn about one event

This starts with the most recent event; It can be significant or just important to me
