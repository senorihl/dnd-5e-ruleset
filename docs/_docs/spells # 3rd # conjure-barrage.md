# Conjure Barrage

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 225)</small>

3rd level conjuration

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Self (60ft cone)

**Components:** V,S,M (One piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon)

**Classes:** [Ranger](/classes/ranger/)

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
