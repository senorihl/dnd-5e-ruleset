## Features

### Tools Proficiency <small>(at level 3)</small>


[proficient with alchemist's supplies]



### Experimental Elixir <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I finish a long rest I can produce a number of elixirs in empty flasks I touch

Also, as an action, I can expend a spell slot to create one elixir in a touched empty flask

I need alchemist supplies on my person to do this; An elixir lasts until my next long rest

For their effects, see the experimental elixir table on a Notes page; They work like potions



### Alchemical Savant <small>(at level 5)</small>


When I cast spells using alchemist's supplies as my spellcasting focus, I can enhance them

I add my Int mod to one roll of acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, or restoring HP



### Restorative Reagents <small>(at level 9)</small>


Drinking my experimental elixirs now also grants 2d6 + my Int mod in temp HP (min 1)

I can cast Lesser Restoration with alchemist's supplies without a spell slot (Int mod times)



### Chemical Mastery <small>(at level 15)</small>


[each spell 1× per long rest]

I have resistance to acid and poison damage and immunity to being poisoned

I can cast Greater Restoration and Heal each once per long rest without a spell slot

I need alchemist's supplies as a focus for it, but the spells require no material components
