[reverts back if I die or don another armor]

Each can hold one infusion; The infusions remain when I change the armor's model

My armor gets additional features, based on the model; Use "Choose Features" to select it

The guardian gets the ability to pull a creature closer as a reaction and make an attack

The infiltrator gets an upgrade to its lightning launcher weapon attack
