## Feature: False Identity


I have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow me to assume that persona. Additionally, I can forge documents, including official papers and personal letters, as long as I have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting I am trying to copy.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone. |
| 2 | I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate. |
| 3 | Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want. |
| 4 | I'm a born gambler who can't resist taking a risk for a potential payoff. |
| 5 | I lie about almost everything, even when there's no good reason to. |
| 6 | Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice. |
| 7 | I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment. |
| 8 | I pocket anything I see that might have some value. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Independence**: I am a free spirit ― no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic) |
| 2 | **Fairness**: I never target people who can't afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Charity**: I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good) |
| 4 | **Creativity**: I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | **Friendship**: Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever. (Good) |
| 6 | **Aspiration**: I'm determined to make something of myself. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about. |
| 2 | I owe everything to my mentor ― a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere. |
| 3 | Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her. |
| 4 | I come from a noble family, and one day I'll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me. |
| 5 | A powerful person killed someone I love. Someday soon, I'll have my revenge. |
| 6 | I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I can't resist a pretty face. |
| 2 | I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in. |
| 3 | I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others. |
| 4 | I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved. |
| 5 | I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me. |
| 6 | I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough. |
