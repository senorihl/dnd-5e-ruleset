## Feature: Kept in Style


While I am in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North my house sees to my everyday needs. My name and signet are sufficient to cover most of my expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls I frequent are glad to record my debt and send an accounting to my family's estate. This advantage enables me to take 2 gp of my daily lifestyle costs down to 0 gp.
