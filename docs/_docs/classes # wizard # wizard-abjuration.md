## Features

### Abjuration Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy abjuration spells into my spellbook



### Arcane Ward <small>(at level 2)</small>


Whenever I cast an 1st-level or higher abjuration spell, I make/heal a ward

I make it at max HP; When I cast again, it heals two HP per spell level

It stays active at 0 HP and doesn't go away until my next long rest

If I take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, but excess damage carries over



### Projected Ward <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction, my Arcane Ward can absorb damage done to a creature within 30 ft



### Improved Abjuration <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I cast an abjuration spell requiring an ability check, I add my proficiency bonus



### Spell Resistance <small>(at level 14)</small>


I have adv. on spell saves and resistance to damaging spells
