## Features

### Manifest Echo <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can magically manifest a translucent image of myself within 15 ft

My echo lasts until I dismiss it as a bonus action, I manifest another, or I'm incapacitated

It is also destroyed if it is more than 30 ft away from me at the end of my turn

It has 1 HP, immunity to all conditions, uses my save bonuses, and AC 14 + Prof. Bonus

On my turn as a free action, I can command it to move up to 30 ft in any direction

As a bonus action, I can teleport to swap places with it, at a cost of 15 ft movement

When I use the Attack action on my turn, I can have any attack originate from my echo

I can also make opportunity attacks from the echo's location as if I were in its space



### Unleash Incarnation <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I use the Attack action, I can make one extra melee attack from my echo's position



### Echo Avatar <small>(at level 7)</small>


As an action, I can temporarily transfer my consciousness to my echo for up to 10 min

During this time, I see and hear through its eyes and ears, but not my own eyes and ears

While I use my echo this way, it can be up to 1000 ft away from me without issue

I can end this at any time, requiring no action



### Shadow Martyr <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction when a creature I can see is attacked, I can make my echo the target

Before the attack roll, the echo teleports to an empty space within 5 ft of the creature

The attack roll of the triggering attack is then made against the echo instead



### Reclaim Potential <small>(at level 15)</small>


When my echo is destroyed by taking damage, I gain 2d6 + my Con mod in temp HP

I can only gain these temporary hit points if I don't already have temporary hit points



### Legion of One <small>(at level 18)</small>


I can now manifest two echoes instead of one with the same bonus action

These two can coexist, but if I manifest a third, the previous two are destroyed

Anything I can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead

I regain one use of Unleash Incarnation if I have no more remaining when I roll initiative
