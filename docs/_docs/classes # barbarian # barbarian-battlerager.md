# Path of the Battlerager

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/sc-adventurers-guide">Sword Coast Adventure Guide</a> (p. 121)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Strength 13
- **Hit dice**: d12

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple, martial
- **Armors:** light, medium, shields

## Equipment


Barbarian starting equipment:

- A greataxe -or- any martial melee weapon;
- Two handaxes -or- any simple weapon;
- An explorer's pack and four javelins.

Alternatively, choose 2d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Battlerager Armor <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency with spiked armor both as an armor and as a weapon

As a bonus action while raging, I can attack once with my armor spikes

With my spiked armor I do 3 piercing damage when I use my Attack action to grapple



### Reckless Abandon <small>(at level 6)</small>


If I use Reckless Attack during rage, I also gain temporary HP equal to my Con mod



### Battlerager Charge <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a bonus action while raging, I can use the Dash action



### Spiked Retribution <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I'm hit in melee by an attacker within 5 ft, it takes 3 piercing damage

This only works while I'm wearing spiked armor, in rage, and I'm not incapacitated
