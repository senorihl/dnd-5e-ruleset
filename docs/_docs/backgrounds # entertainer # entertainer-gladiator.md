## Feature: Are You Entertained?


I can always find a place to perform (arena/pit fight), where I receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard, as long as I perform each night. In addition, my performance makes me something of a local figure. When strangers recognize me in a town where I have performed, they typically take a liking to me.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I know a story relevant to almost every situation. |
| 2 | Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip. |
| 3 | I'm a hopeless romantic, always searching for that 'special someone'. |
| 4 | Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. |
| 5 | I love a good insult, even one directed at me. |
| 6 | I get bitter if I'm not the center of attention. |
| 7 | I'll settle for nothing less than perfection. |
| 8 | I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Beauty**: When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Good) |
| 2 | **Tradition**: The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Creativity**: The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Greed**: I'm only in it for the money and fame. [Evil] |
| 5 | **People**: I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when I perform. That's all that matters. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Honesty**: Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love. |
| 2 | Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I'll get it back. |

|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'll do anything to win fame and renown. |
| 2 | I'm a sucker for a pretty face. |
| 3 | A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around. |
| 4 | I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat. |
| 5 | I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble. |
| 6 | Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends. |
