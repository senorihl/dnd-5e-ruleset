### Tokens of the Departed <small>(at level 9)</small>


[max Proficiency Bonus of soul trinkets]

As a reaction when I see a creature within 30 ft die, I can create a Tiny soul trinket

The token of its life essence appears in my free hand; The DM determines its appearance

While a soul trinket is on my person, I have advantage on death and Constitution saves

As an action, I can destroy one of my soul trinkets and ask its associated spirit a question

Its spirit appears and answers concisely in a language it knew; Trinket can be anywhere



### Ghost Walk <small>(at level 13)</small>


As a bonus action, I can assume a spectral form with 10 ft flying speed and can hover

Attacks vs. me have disadv.; I can move through creatures and objects as difficult terrain

This lasts 10 min; I take 1d10 force damage if I end my turn inside a creature or object

I can assume this form once per long rest, or by destroying one of my soul trinkets (ST)



### Death's Friend <small>(at level 17)</small>


Wails from the Grave now also deals damage to the target of the original sneak attack

If I don't have any soul trinkets at the end of a long rest, one appears in my hand
