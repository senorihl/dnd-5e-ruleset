<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 150), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 246)</small>

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Ranger](/classes/ranger/)

Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

   The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
