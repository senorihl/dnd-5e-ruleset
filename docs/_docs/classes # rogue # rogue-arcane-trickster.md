## Features

### Spellcasting <small>(at level 3)</small>


I can cast known wizard cantrips/spells, using Intelligence as my spellcasting ability



### Mage Hand Legerdemain <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can direct my Mage Hand

With a Dex (Sleight of Hand) vs. Wis (Perception) checks, I can do so discreetly

I can make it invisible and perform the following tasks:
- Stow/retrieve an object the hand is holding in a container worn/carried by another
- Use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range



### Magical Ambush <small>(at level 9)</small>


When I cast a spell while hidden, the target(s) have disadvantage against that spell



### Versatile Trickster <small>(at level 13)</small>


As a bonus action, gain adv. on attacks this turn on creature within 5 ft of Mage Hand



### Spell Thief <small>(at level 17)</small>


As a reaction, after a spell is cast at me, I can try to negate and steal it

The caster makes a save against my spell DC with his/her spellcasting ability

On failure, the caster forgets how to cast that spell for eight hours

If I have a spell slot of a high enough level for it, I learn how to cast it during this time
