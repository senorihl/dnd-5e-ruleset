- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13

## Features

### Chronal Shift <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a reaction after I or a creature I see rolls a check, save, or attack, I can force a reroll

I can do this after I see if the roll fails or succeeds; The target must use the second roll.



### Temporal Awareness <small>(at level 2)</small>


I gain a bonus to my initiative rolls equal to my Intelligence modifier



### Momentary Stasis <small>(at level 6)</small>


As an action, I can have a Large or smaller creature I can see in 60 ft make a Con save

If failed, it is encased in a field of magical energy, incapacitated and has a speed of 0

This lasts until the end of my next turn or until the creature takes any damage



### Arcane Abeyance <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I use a spell slot to cast a 4th-level or lower spell, I can condense it into a mote

The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a grey bead

The bead is a Tiny object with 1 HP, AC 15, and immune to poison and psychic damage

After 1 hour or if it is destroyed, it vanishes with a flash of light and the spell is lost

As an action, a creature holding the bead can release the spell within as if they cast it

The spell still uses my spell attack bonus and save DC; The bead vanishes once used



### Convergent Future <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a reaction after I or a creature I see rolls a check, save, or attack, I can choose the roll

I decide the number rolled, if it is the minimum needed to succeed or 1 less than that

When I use this feature, I gain a level of exhaustion which only a long rest can remove
