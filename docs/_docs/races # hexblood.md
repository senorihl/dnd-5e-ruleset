<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/van-richtens-guide-ravenloft">Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</a> (p. 18)</small>


## Traits

- **Fey**: My creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
- **Eerie Token**: As a bonus action once per long rest, I can harmlessly remove a lock of my hair, one of my nails or teeth and imbue this token with magic until I finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, I can telepathically speak to a creature holding it or see and hear around it. See the Notes page for more information.
- **Hex Magic**: I known Disguise Self and Hex. I can cast each spell once per long rest without using a spell slot, or by using a spell slot as normal.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, 1 of your choice
