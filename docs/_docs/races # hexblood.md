- **Scores:** +2 to one ability score and +1 to a different score of my choice, -or- +1 to three different scores of my choice

## Traits

- **Fey**: My creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
- **Eerie Token**: As a bonus action once per long rest, I can harmlessly remove a lock of my hair, one of my nails or teeth and imbue this token with magic until I finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, I can telepathically speak to a creature holding it or see and hear around it. See the Notes page for more information.
- **Hex Magic**: I known Disguise Self and Hex. I can cast each spell once per long rest without using a spell slot, or by using a spell slot as normal.
