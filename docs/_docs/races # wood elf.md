# Wood elf

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 24)</small>
**Scores:** +2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom

## General information

- **Age:** Wood elves typically claim adulthood around age 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
- **Height:** Wood elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall (4'6" + 2d10").
- **Weight:** Wood elves weigh around 125 lb (100 + 2d10 Ã— 1d4 lb).

## Traits

- **Trance**: Elves don't need to sleep, but meditate semiconsciously, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, I can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, I gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep, thus needing only 4 hours for a long rest.
- **Mask of the Wild**: I can attempt to hide even when I am only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

## Proficiencies

- **Languages:** Common, Elvish
- **Weapons:** longsword, shortsword, longbow, shortbow
