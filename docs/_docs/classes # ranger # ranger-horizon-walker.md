- **Prerequisites**: Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
- **Hit dice**: d10

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple, martial
- **Armors:** light, medium, shields

## Equipment


Ranger starting equipment:

- Scale mail -or- leather armor;
- Two shortswords -or- two simple melee weapons;
- A dungeoneer's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows.

Alternatively, choose 5d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Detect Portal <small>(at level 3)</small>


As an action, I sense the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile



### Horizon Walker Magic <small>(at level 3)</small>


I add a spell to my known spells at level 3, 5, 9, 13, and 17

These count as ranger spells, but do not count against the number of spells I can know



### Planar Warrior <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I choose one creature that I can see within 30 ft of me

All damage from my first weapon attack that hits it on this turn becomes force damage

In addition, that first hit does extra damage



### Ethereal Step <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a bonus action, I can cast the Etherealness spell, which lasts until the end of my turn



### Distant Strike <small>(at level 11)</small>


With the Attack action, I can teleport 10 ft before each attack, to a place I can see

If I attack two different creatures with this action, I get an extra attack against a third



### Spectral Defense <small>(at level 15)</small>


As a reaction when an attack damages me, I can give myself resistance vs. that attack
