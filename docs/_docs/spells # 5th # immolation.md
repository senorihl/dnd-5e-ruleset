5th level evocation

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 90 ft

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Conc, 1 min

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.

   If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.
