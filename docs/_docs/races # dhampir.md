## Traits

- **Deathless Nature**: I don't need to breathe.
- **Spider Climb**: Climbing speed equal to walking speed. At 3rd level, I can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving my hands free.
- **Vampiric Bite**: Uses Constitution and has adv. on the attack roll if I'm at or below half HP. My Proficiency Bonus per long rest, when I hit a creature other than a construct or undead, I can empower myself. I either regain HP or gain a bonus on my next ability check or attack roll. The bonus is equal to the piercing damage dealt.
