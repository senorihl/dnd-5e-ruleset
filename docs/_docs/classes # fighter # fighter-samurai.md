As a bonus action, I can give myself advantage on weapon attacks and temporary HP

This advantage on weapon attack rolls lasts until the end of my current turn

I can add my Wisdom modifier to any Charisma (Persuasion) checks I make

I gain proficiency with Wis saves, or if I'm already proficient, either Int or Cha saves



### Tireless Spirit <small>(at level 10)</small>


I regain one use of Fighting Spirit if I have no more remaining when I roll initiative



### Rapid Strike <small>(at level 15)</small>


With the Attack action, I can forgo advantage on one attack to make one extra attack

This extra attack is part of the same action; I can do this only once per turn

If I'm reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, I can delay falling unconscious

I then immediately take a bonus turn, interrupting the current turn

While I'm at 0 HP, I suffer damage normally and die if I have 3 failed death saves

If I'm still at 0 HP at the end of this bonus turn, I fall unconscious
