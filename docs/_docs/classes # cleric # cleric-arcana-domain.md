## Features

### Arcane Initiate <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain proficiency with Arcana and two wizard cantrips that count as cleric cantrips



### Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 ft must make a Wis save

If it fails and is able to see/hear me, it is turned for 1 min or until it takes damage

Turned: move away, never within 30 ft of me, no reactions or actions other than Dash

Turned: may Dodge instead of Dash when nowhere to move and unable to escape bonds

If its CR is low enough and it is not on its home plane, it is banished for 1 min instead

Banished: sent to home plane, reappearing where it was if the effect ends before 1 min



### Spell Breaker <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I restore HP to an ally with a 1st-level or higher spell, I can also end one spell

The chosen spell on the ally ends if it is equal or lower level to the spell slot level used



### Potent Spellcasting or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Potent Spellcasting or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Potent Spellcasting**: 
   I add my Wisdom modifier to the damage I deal with my cleric cantrips
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Arcane Mastery <small>(at level 17)</small>


I add four wizards spells, a 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level spell, to my domain spells

As any domain spell, these spells are automatically prepared and count as cleric spells
