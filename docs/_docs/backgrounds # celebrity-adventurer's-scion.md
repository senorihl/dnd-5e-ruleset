## Feature: Name Dropping


I know and have met any number of powerful people across the land, and some might even remember me. I might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat me with deference, and my heritage and the stories I tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I will never get out of my famous parent's shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden. |
| 2 | I've seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers. |
| 3 | Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I'm going to do it. |
| 4 | I'm used to the very best in life, and that's a hard habit to break. |
| 5 | My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me. |
| 6 | No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can. |
| 7 | I've been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you. |
| 8 | No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies... and taking their stuff. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Power**. The only way to get ahead in this world is to attain power and hold onto it with all your might. (Evil) |
| 2 | **Peace**. Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Fame**. I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral) |
| 4 | **Training**. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to successâ€”and eventually to perfection. (Any) |
| 5 | **Anonymity**. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any) |
| 6 | **Wisdom**. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone. |
| 2 | I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family. |
| 3 | Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud. |
| 4 | My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession. |
| 5 | My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern. |
| 6 | Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | You don't know what I'm going through. You never can. |
| 2 | You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while. |
| 3 | My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth. |
| 4 | Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them. |
| 5 | My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death. |
| 6 | You have to look out for yourself. No one else will. |
