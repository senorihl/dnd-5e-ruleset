After I hit with an opportunity attack, I can move 1/2 my speed in the same reaction

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks

As a reaction, I can make a melee weapon attack against it if it is within range

When a creature first enters or starts its turn in the aura, it must make a Wis save

If failed, for 1 min or until it takes damage, it is frightened and attacks vs. it have adv.
