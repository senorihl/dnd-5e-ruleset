## Feature: Safe Haven


As a faction agent, I have access to a secret network of support and operatives who can provide assistance on my adventures. I know secret signs and passwords to identify such operatives, who can provide me with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives or identity for me.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I venerate a distinct hero of my faith, and persistently reference that individual's accomplishments and lessons. |
| 2 | I can find universal ground between the most vehement enemies, sympathizing with them and always moving toward unity. |
| 3 | I see portents in all things. The gods attempt to communicate to us, we just need to pay attention. |
| 4 | Nothing can rattle my positive attitude. |
| 5 | I quote (or misquote) holy scripture and aphorisms in nearly all circumstances. |
| 6 | I am accepting (or unaccepting) of other faiths and honor (or dishonor) the devotion to other deities. |
| 7 | I've enjoyed exquisite food, drink, and aristocracy among my faith's most elite. Rougher lifestyles chafe me. |
| 8 | I've spent so much time in the confines of the temple that I have few functional skills interacting with individuals in the rest of the world. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Tradition**: The age-old institutions of devotion and forfeiture must be sustained and maintained. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Charity**: I always attempt to assist those in need, regardless of the personal cost. (Good) |
| 3 | **Change**: We must help induce the developments the gods are continually cultivating in the world. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Power**: I aspire to someday ascend to the elite of my faith's highest echelon. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Faith**: I believe that my deity will direct my work. I have confidence that if I work diligently, my work will be rewarded. (Lawful) |
| 6 | **Aspiration**: I aim to demonstrate myself worth my deity's favor by paralleling my actions against their instruction. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I would sacrifice anything to recover a long lost ancient relic of my temple (or faith). |
| 2 | I will get revenge on my temple's corrupted hierarchy that branded me a heretic. |
| 3 | I can never repay what I owe to the priest that took me in as an orphan. |
| 4 | Everything I do is for those less fortunate. |
| 5 | I will do whatever is necessary to keep my temple safe. |
| 6 | I safeguard holy scripture that some claim is heretical and seek to destroy. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I hold others to a high standard, and myself even higher. |
| 2 | I place too much faith in those most powerful within my temple's hierarchy. |
| 3 | My religiosity can lead me to naively trust those that claim faith in my deity. |
| 4 | I am very stubborn in my thinking. |
| 5 | I am pessimistic and distrustful of strangers. |
| 6 | Once I choose an objective, I become so single minded that the rest of my life fades into the background. |
