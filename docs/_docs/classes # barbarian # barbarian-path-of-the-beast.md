# Path of the Beast

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tashas-cauldron-everything">Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</a> (p. 24)</small>

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 13
- **Hit dice**: d12

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** simple, martial
- **Armors:** light, medium, shields

## Equipment


Barbarian starting equipment:

- A greataxe -or- any martial melee weapon;
- Two handaxes -or- any simple weapon;
- An explorer's pack and four javelins.

Alternatively, choose 2d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Form of the Beast <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I enter my rage, I can transform to gain a bite, tail, or claws attack for that rage

On a hit with the bite attack once on each of my turns, I can heal my Prof. Bonus in HP

This only works if I have less than half my hit points when I hit with this bite attack

With the claws I can make one extra attack when I attack with it in my Attack action

As a reaction with the tail when I'm hit, I can add 1d8 to my AC for that attack

This only works if the hit is from an attack roll made a creature I can see within 30 ft



### Bestial Soul <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I finish a short rest, I can choose one of the following benefits until my next rest:
- Swimming speed equal to my walking speed and I can breathe underwater
- Climb speed (same as walking) and no check to climb difficult surfaces or upside down
- Once per turn when I jump, I can extend it by the result of an Athletics check in feet



### Infectious Fury <small>(at level 10)</small>


In rage, when I hit a creature with my natural weapon, I can have it make a Wis save

If it fails (DC 8 + my Prof bonus + my Con mod) it suffers one effect of my choice:
- It uses its reaction to make a melee attack against one creature I can see of my choice
- It takes 2d12 psychic damage



### Call the Hunt <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I enter rage, I can choose my Con mod of willing creatures I can see within 30 ft

Once on each of their turns, if they hit an attack, they can have it deal +1d6 damage

This lasts as long as I rage; I gain 5 temporary HP per creature that accepts this benefit
