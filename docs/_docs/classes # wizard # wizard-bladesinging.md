## Features

### Training in War and Song <small>(at level 2)</small>


I gain proficiency with light armor, a one-handed melee weapon, and Performance



### Bladesong <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action, I can start the bladesong for 1 minute; I can dismiss it at any time

It stops when I wear a shield, medium or heavy armor, or attack with two hands

While the bladesong is active I have the following benefits:
- Intelligence modifier (min 1) to AC
- Base walking speed increases by 10 foot
- Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks
- Intelligence modifier (min 1) to concentration saves for maintaining conc. on a spell



### Extra Attack <small>(at level 6)</small>


I can attack twice instead of once when I take the Attack action on my turn

Moreover, I can cast one of my cantrips in place of one of those attacks



### Song of Defense <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction while my bladesong is active, I can expend a spell slot to reduce damage

The damage I take is reduced by 5 for every level of the spell slot I expend

While my bladesong is active, I add my Int mod (min 1) to melee weapon attack damage
