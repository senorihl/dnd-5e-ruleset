# School of Divination

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;

Alternatively, choose 4d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Divination Savant <small>(at level 2)</small>


I halve the gp and time needed to copy divination spells into my spellbook



### Portent <small>(at level 2)</small>


After a long rest, I roll dice and keep the results to be used before my next rest

A result can replace an attack/save/ability check made by me or a creature I can see

I choose to switch them before the dice to be replaced are rolled; Max once per turn



### Expert Divination <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I cast a divination spell, I recover a spell slot of a lower level than the one I cast



### The Third Eye <small>(at level 10)</small>


As an action, I gain one of the following until my next short or long rest:

Darkvision 60ft, see the Ethereal Plane 60ft, read any language, or see invisibility 10ft



### Greater Portent <small>(at level 14)</small>


I can roll 3d20 instead of 2d20 when using my Portent feature
