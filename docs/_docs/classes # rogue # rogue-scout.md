## Features

### Skirmisher <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a reaction when a hostile ends its turn within 5 ft of me, I can move half my speed

This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity



### Survivalist <small>(at level 3)</small>


I gain proficiency and expertise with the Nature and Survival skills



### Superior Mobility <small>(at level 9)</small>


I gain +10 ft to my walking speed (and swimming/climbing speed, if applicable)



### Ambush Master <small>(at level 13)</small>


I gain advantage on Initiative rolls

The first creature I hit in the first round of combat becomes an easy target

Until the start of my next turn, all attacks against the target have advantage



### Sudden Strike <small>(at level 17)</small>


With the Attack action, I can make one additional attack as a bonus action

This attack can benefit from my Sneak Attack even if I already used it this turn

However, I still can't use Sneak Attack on a single target more than once per turn
