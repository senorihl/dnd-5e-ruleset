<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf">System Reference Document 5.1</a> (p. 146), <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 243)</small>


1st level conjuration

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V,S 

**Duration:** Conc, 1 h

**Classes:** [Druid](/classes/druid/), [Ranger](/classes/ranger/), [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
