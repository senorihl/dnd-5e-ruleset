## Feature: Official Inquiry


Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, I can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime I'm investigating. Those who aren't involved in my investigation avoid impeding me or pass along my requests. Local law enforcement has firm opinions, viewing me as either a nuisance or one of their own.
