## Feature: Adept Linguist


I can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language I know. I must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least one day, after which I learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures ― enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d6 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I prefer the company of those who aren't like me, including people of other races. |
| 2 | I'm a stickler when it comes to observing proper etiquette and local customs. |
| 3 | I would rather observe than meddle. |
| 4 | By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence. |
| 5 | I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one. |
| 6 | When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Discovery**: I want to be the first person to discover a lost culture. (Any) |
| 2 | **Distance**: One must not interfere with the affairs of another culture ― even one in need of aid. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Knowledge**: By understanding other races and cultures, we learn to understand ourselves. (Any) |
| 4 | **Power**: Common people crave strong leadership, and I do my utmost to provide it. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Protection**: I must do everything possible to save a society facing extinction. (Good) |
| 6 | **Indifferent**: Life is cruel. What's the point in saving people if they're going to die anyway? (Chaotic) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | My mentor gave me a journal filled with lore and wisdom. Losing it would devastate me. |

| 3 | Years ago, tragedy struck the members of an isolated society I befriended, and I will honor them. |

| 5 | I seek to avenge a clan, tribe, kingdom, or empire that was wiped out. |
| 6 | I have a trinket that I believe is the key to finding a long-lost society. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Boats make me seasick. |
| 2 | I talk to myself, and I don't make friends easily. |
| 3 | I believe that I'm intellectually superior to people from other cultures and have much to teach them. |
| 4 | I've picked up some unpleasant habits living among goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs. |
| 5 | I complain about everything. |
| 6 | I wear a tribal mask and never take it off. |
