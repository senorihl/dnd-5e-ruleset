# Shadow Magic

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 50)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

- **Weapons:** dagger, dart, light crossbow, quarterstaff, sling

## Equipment


Sorcerer starting equipment:

- A light crossbow and 20 bolts -or- any simple weapon;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;
- A dungeoneer's pack -or- an explorer's pack;
- Two daggers.

Alternatively, choose 3d4 Ã— 10 gp worth of starting equipment instead of both the class' and the background's starting equipment.


## Features

### Eyes of the Dark <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain 120 ft darkvision



### Strength of the Grave <small>(at level 1)</small>


When damage reduces me to 0 HP, that isn't radiant damage or a critical hit,

I can make a Charisma save (DC 5 + damage taken) to drop to 1 HP instead



### Darkness <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn Darkness, which doesn't count against my number of spells known

I can also cast it by spending 2 sorcery points and then I can see through it normally



### Hound of Ill Omen <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a bonus action, I summon a hound within 30 ft of a creature I see within 120 ft

The hound has all the stats of a dire wolf with the following exceptions:
- It is medium size and counts as a monstrosity not a beast
- It starts with a number of temporary hit points equal to half my sorcerer level
- At the start of its turn, it automatically knows where the (hidden) target is
- It can only move towards and make (opportunity) attack against the target
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain
- It takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object

The target has disadvantage on saves vs. my spells while the hound is within 5 ft of it

It disappears if reduced to 0 HP, if the target is reduced to 0 HP, or after 5 minutes



### Shadow Walk <small>(at level 14)</small>


As a bonus action when I'm in dim light or darkness, I can teleport up to 120 ft

The destination has to be unoccupied, within line of sight, and in dim light or darkness



### Umbral Form <small>(at level 18)</small>


As a bonus action, I transform into a shadow form for 1 minute

While transformed, I have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage

Also, I can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain

I take 5 force damage if I end my turn inside an object

This ends early if I end it as a bonus action, I die, or I'm incapacitated
