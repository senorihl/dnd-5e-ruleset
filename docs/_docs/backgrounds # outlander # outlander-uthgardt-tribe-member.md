## Feature: Uthgardt Heritage


I have an excellent knowledge of my tribe's territory, and surrounding terrain and natural resources. I am familiar enough with any wilderness area that I can find twice as much food and water as one normally would. I can call upon the hospitality of my people, and those allied, often including members of druid circles, nomadic elves, and priesthoods.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home. |
| 2 | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups. |
| 3 | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to. |
| 4 | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature. |
| 5 | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear. |
| 6 | I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them. |
| 7 | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people. |
| 8 | I was, in fact, raised by wolves. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Change**: Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic) |
| 2 | **Greater Good**: It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good) |
| 3 | **Honor**: If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful) |
| 4 | **Might**: The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil) |
| 5 | **Nature**: The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Glory**: I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. |
| 2 | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me. |
| 3 | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland. |
| 4 | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend. |
| 5 | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it. |
| 6 | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants. |
| 2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest. |
| 3 | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me. |
| 4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies. |
| 5 | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge. |
| 6 | Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. |
