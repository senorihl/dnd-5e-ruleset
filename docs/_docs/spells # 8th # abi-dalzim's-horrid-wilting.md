8th level necromancy

**Casting time:** 1 a

**Range:** 150 ft

**Components:** V,S,M (A bit of sponge)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** [Sorcerer](/classes/sorcerer/), [Wizard](/classes/wizard/)

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

   Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
