### Implement of Peace <small>(at level undefined)</small>


I gain proficiency in the Insight, Performance, or Persuasion skill (my choice)



### Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can move up to my speed without provoking opportunity attacks

During this move, I can heal each creature that I come within 5 ft of once

I restore a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + my Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 HP)



### Protective Bond <small>(at level 6)</small>


My Emboldening Bond now also helps those bonded to protect each other if within range

When one is about to take damage, another bonded can use its reaction to teleport closer

They teleport to an empty space within 5 ft of the first and take all the damage instead

From 17th-level, they count as having resistance for this damage, thus take only half



### Potent Spellcasting <small>(at level 8)</small>


I add my Wisdom modifier to the damage I deal with my cleric cantrips



### Expansive Bond <small>(at level 17)</small>


Emboldening and Protective Bond work when the bonded are within 60 ft of each other

Protective Bond now also grants resistance when used to take damage for another
