## Feature: Leverage


I can exert leverage over one or more below me in the guild's hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, deliver a message, arrange a ride, or clean up a bloody mess. As my status in the guild improves, I gain influence over more people of higher station. The DM decides if the demands are reasonable and if subordinates are available.
