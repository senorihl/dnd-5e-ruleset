## Feature: Deep Miner


I am used to navigating the deep places of the earth. I never get lost in caves or mines if I have either seen an accurate map of them or have been through them before. Furthermore, I am able to scrounge fresh water and food for myself and as many as five other people each day if I am in a mine or natural caves.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Nothing bothers me for long. |
| 2 | I hate the horrors of the Underdark with a passion. They took my friends and family and almost got me. |
| 3 | Anything worth doing takes time and patience. I have learned to plan and wait for the things I want and to be patient to achieve my goals. |
| 4 | I can party with everyone. Whether with dwarves, or goliaths, or deep gnomes, I can find a way to have a good time. |
| 5 | I'd rather be mining. This is okay; mining is better. |
| 6 | I think that I will stumble upon great riches if I just keep looking. |
| 7 | People who don't work with their hands and who live in houses are soft and weak. |
| 8 | I wish I were more educated. I look up to people who are. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Generosity**: The riches of the earth are to be shared by all. (Good) |
| 2 | **Greed**: Gems and precious metals, I want them all for myself. (Evil) |
| 3 | **Mooch**: Property, schmoperty. If I need it, I take and use it. If I don't, I leave it for someone else. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Boundaries**: Everything and everyone has its prescribed place; I respect that and expect others to do the same. (Lawful)  |
| 5 | **Let it Be**: I don't meddle in the affairs of others if I can avoid it. They're none of my business. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Materialist**: I want riches to improve my life. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The people of the Earthspur mines are my family. I will do anything to protect them. |
| 2 | A deep gnome saved my life when I was injured and alone. I owe his people a great debt. |
| 3 | I must behold and preserve the natural beauty of places below the earth. |
| 4 | Gems hold a special fascination for me, more than gold, land, magic, or power. |
| 5 | I want to explore new depths and scale new heights. |
| 6 | Someday I'm going to find the mother lode, then I'll spend the rest of my life in luxury. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'm uncomfortable spending time under the open sky. I'd rather be indoors or underground. |
| 2 | I'm not used to being around other people much and sometimes get grouchy about it. |
| 3 | Good tools are more reliable than people. In a cave in, I would save a sturdy pick before a stranger. |
| 4 | I jealously guard my secrets, because I think others will take advantage of me if they learn what I know. |
| 5 | I am obsessed with getting rich. I always have a scheme brewing for making it big. |
| 6 | I'm afraid of the dark. |
