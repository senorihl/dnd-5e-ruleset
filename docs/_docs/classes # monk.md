Without armor and no shield, my AC is 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier

Monk weapons: any simple melee (not two-handed/heavy), unarmed strike, shortsword

With monk weapons, I can use Dex instead of Str and use the Martial Arts damage die

When taking an Attack action with these, I get one unarmed strike as a bonus action

I can spend ki points to fuel special actions (see third page)

I need to meditate for at least 30 min of a short rest for that short rest to restore ki

Speed increases and eventually lets me traverse some surfaces without falling as I move

As a reaction, I can reduce any falling damage I take by five times my monk level



### Ki-Empowered Strikes <small>(at level 6)</small>


My unarmed strikes count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities



### Evasion <small>(at level 7)</small>


My Dexterity saves vs. areas of effect negate damage on success and halve it on failure

As an action, I can end one effect on me that causes me to be charmed or frightened
