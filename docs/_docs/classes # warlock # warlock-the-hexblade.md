## Features

### Hexblade's Curse <small>(at level 1)</small>


As a bonus action, I can curse a creature I can see within 30 ft of me for 1 minute
- I add my proficiency bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target
- My attack rolls against the curse target score a critical hit on a roll of 19 and 20
- If the target dies while cursed, I regain HP equal to my warlock level + Cha mod

The curse ends after 1 minute, when the target dies, I die, or I'm incapacitated



### Hex Warrior <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons

When I finish a long rest, I can imbue one weapon I touch with my will

Until my next long rest, I can use it with Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity

I have to be proficient with the weapon and it can't have the two-handed property

This benefit also works with every weapon from Pact of the Blade, with no restriction



### Accursed Specter <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I slay a humanoid, I can curse its soul and have it rise as a specter from its corpse

It has the stats of a specter with temporary hit points equal to half my warlock level

It rolls initiative and has its own turns, obeying my verbal commands

It gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to my Charisma modifier (min +0)

The specter remains until the end of my next long rest, at which point it vanishes



### Armor of Hexes <small>(at level 10)</small>


As a reaction when a Hexblade's Curse recipient hits me with an attack, I can roll a d6

On a result of 4 or higher, the attacks misses me instead, regardless of its d20 roll



### Master of Hexes <small>(at level 14)</small>


When the target of my Hexblade's Curse dies, I can curse another I can see within 30 ft

I can't do this while incapacitated and I don't regain HP from the death of the previous
