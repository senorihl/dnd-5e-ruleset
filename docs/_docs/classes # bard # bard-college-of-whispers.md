## Features

### Psychic Blades <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I hit a creature with a weapon attack, I can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration

If so, the attack does extra psychic damage; I can do so only once per round, on my turn



### Words of Terror <small>(at level 3)</small>


By speaking privately with a humanoid for at least 1 minute, I can try to inspire terror

After the talk, it must make a Wis save or be frightened of me or someone of my choice

If the save is successful, the target doesn't know I tried to frighten it

This lasts for 1 hour, or until it sees its allies or itself being attacked or damaged



### Mantle of Whispers <small>(at level 6)</small>


As a reaction when a humanoid dies within 30 ft of me, I can capture its shadow

As an action, I can use it to make me look just like the dead person did while it was alive

While disguised, I know general information about it and its memories, but not its secrets

Others can see through the disguise with a Wis (Insight) check vs. my Cha (Deception) +5

A shadow lasts until used or next long rest; The disguise ends as a bonus action or 1 hour



### Shadow Lore <small>(at level 14)</small>


As an action, I whisper to a creature within 30 ft that can hear and understand me

Only the target can hear me; It must make a Wis save or be charmed by me for 8 hours

If failed, it thinks I know its most mortifying secret, otherwise it only hears mumbling

While charmed, the target obeys my commands, but won't fight or risk its life for me

This lasts for 8 hours, or until I or my allies attack it, damage it, or have it make a save
