## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | My previous employer didn't respect me, and now I'll do whatever I can to gain respect. |
| 2 | The job is important, but the relationships I forge with my coworkers are even more so. |
| 3 | The job is everything to me. Who needs relaxation, hobbies, and a social life? |
| 4 | I know I'm not the best and brightest, but if I put my best self forward, I can overcome anything. |
| 5 | My former boss was an idiot. So was my boss before that. And before that. I'm sure those were all coincidences. |
| 6 | This company is so much better than my previous one. It will always be the best until they stop paying me. |
| 7 | I know this dagger belongs to the company, but I'm sure they won't miss it. Or this flask. Or this armor. |
| 8 | It's only a matter of time before I'll be upper management. I just have to kiss up to my superiors and kick down those beneath me. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Advancement**. Money and power can be gained more easily within an organization. I plan to gain as much as possible. (Evil) |
| 2 | **Structure**. Life goes much more smoothly when you follow the rules and work within a system. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Uncertainty**. The more chaos that swirls around me, the more opportunities I can find to profit. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Justice**. I can't stand people being treated unjustly. I do whatever it takes to stop injustice and those who flout the law. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Pleasure**. What's the use of working hard and making money if you can't enjoy the finer things in life? (Any) |
| 6 | **Power**. Money is fine, but real power means never having to say you're sorry. (Evil) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have a family member in need. I consider them in everything I do. |
| 2 | My peers keep me grounded. |
| 3 | My past mistakes cost someone else dearly. I have to rectify that. |
| 4 | A childhood mentor put me on my current path. If I succeed, I want to repay that mentor in some way. |
| 5 | I value an oath of loyalty I took to a group of friends over everything else in my life. |
| 6 | Although I don't get along well with people, my pet means the world to me. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I know what's best. Trust me. |
| 2 | Flaw? I have no flaws. I'm perfect. |
| 3 | My loyalties are... fluid. |
| 4 | If anything goes wrong, it must be someone else's fault. Let me explain that in detail. |
| 5 | There's right and there's wrong, and there's no gray area in between. |
| 6 | Our superiors might not like what you're doing. I'm going to have to put that in my report. |
