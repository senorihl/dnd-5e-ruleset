## Feature: Court Functionary


My knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets me gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government I encounter. I know or can easily acquire the knowledge who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors I seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.
