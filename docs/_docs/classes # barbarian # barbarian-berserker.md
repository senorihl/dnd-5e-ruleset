## Features

### Frenzy <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action each turn while raging, I can make a melee attack

After my rage is over, I suffer one level of exhaustion



### Mindless Rage <small>(at level 6)</small>


While raging, I can't be charmed or frightened, and such effects are suspended



### Intimidating Presence <small>(at level 10)</small>


As an action, frighten one creature in 30 ft for one turn if it fails a Wisdom save

This effect ends if the creature is out of line of sight or more than 60 ft away

If a creature succeeds its saving throw, it is immune for 24 hours



### Retaliation <small>(at level 14)</small>


When an enemy within 5 ft damages me, I can make a melee attack as a reaction
