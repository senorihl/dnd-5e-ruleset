## Features

### Star Map <small>(at level 2)</small>


I've created a star map, a Tiny object which I can use as my spellcasting focus

If I lose it, I can preform a 1-hour ceremony during a rest to create a replacement

While holding it, I know the Guidance cantrip and always have Guiding Bolt prepared

These count as druid spells, but do not count against the number of spells I can prepare

I can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot my Proficiency Bonus per long rest



### Starry Form <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a bonus action, I can expend a use of wild shape to take on a starry form for 10 min

In that form I shed bright light in a 10-ft radius and dim light for an extra 10-ft radius

When I do so, I choose one constellation that glimmers on my body, granting me benefits

See the 3rd page's "Notes" section for the benefits of the possible constellations



### Cosmic Omen <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I finish a long rest, I roll a die to gain an omen based on the result (odd/even)

As a reaction when a creature I can see in 30 ft makes an attack, check, or save, I can:
- Weal (even): add 1d6 to the number rolled for the attack, check, or save
- Woe (odd): subtract 1d6 from the number rolled for the attack, check, or save



### Twinkling Constellations <small>(at level 10)</small>


While in my starry form, I can change the constellation at the start of each of my turns

The benefit of my constellations improve, see the 3rd page's "Notes" section



### Full of Stars <small>(at level 14)</small>


While in my starry form, I have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
