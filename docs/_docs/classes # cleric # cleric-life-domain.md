## Features

### Bonus Proficiency <small>(at level 1)</small>


I gain proficiency with heavy armor

Whenever a 1st-level or higher spell I cast restores HP to a creature, it heals more

The creature regains an additional 2 + spell level (SL) worth of hit points

Note that "X/SL" on the spell page means per spell slot level above the spell's normal level



### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life <small>(at level 2)</small>


As an action, I can heal any creature within 30 ft of me up to half their maximum HP

I divide the number of hit points among the creatures as I see fit



### Blessed Healer <small>(at level 6)</small>


When I restore HP to another with a spell, I regain 2 + the spell (slot) level in HP



### Divine Strike or a Variant <small>(at level 8)</small>


Select Divine Strike or a variant using the "Choose Feature" button above
#### Choices
- **Divine Strike**: 
   Once per turn, when I hit a creature with a weapon attack, I can do extra damage
- **Blessed Strikes**: 
   When my weapon attack or cantrip damages a creature, I can do +1d8 radiant damage
   Once I deal this extra damage, I can't do so again until the start of my next turn






### Supreme Healing <small>(at level 17)</small>


When I restore HP with a spell, I heal the maximum amount instead of rolling the dice
