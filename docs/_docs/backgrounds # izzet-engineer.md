## Feature: Urban Infrastructure


Although the Izzet League is infamous for mad inventions it is also involved in construction of the city's infrastructure. I have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings and what is behind its walls. I can find their blueprints showing entry points, secret spaces, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. My guild won't protect me if I use this knowledge unlawfully.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have a hard time staying focused on ... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one ... did I mention focus? |
| 2 | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is! |
| 3 | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got. |
| 4 | I do what my gut tells me. |
| 5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens. |
| 6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension. |
| 7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts. |
| 8 | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Guild**: My guild is all that really matters. (Any) |
| 2 | **Creativity**: Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | **Discovery**: Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any) |
| 4 | **Science**: A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Fun**: I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | **Power**: Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem. |
| 2 | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me. |
| 3 | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it. |
| 4 | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources. |
| 5 | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle. |
| 6 | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it. |
| 2 | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen. |
| 3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated. |
| 4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety. |
| 5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect. |
| 6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic. |
