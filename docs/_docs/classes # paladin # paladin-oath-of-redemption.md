## Features

### Channel Divinity: Emissary of Peace <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I grant myself +5 on Charisma (Persuasion) checks for 10 minutes



### Channel Divinity: Rebuke the Violent <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a reaction after a creature within 30 ft attacks and damages another, I can rebuke it

It takes the same damage as it dealt but as radiant damage, with a Wis save to halve it



### Aura of the Guardian <small>(at level 7)</small>


As a reaction when an ally within my aura takes damage, I instead take the damage

This damage can't be reduced in any way; Other effects might still apply to my ally



### Protective Spirit <small>(at level 15)</small>


At the end of my turn when I'm below half HP and not incapacitated, I regain HP



### Emissary of Redemption <small>(at level 20)</small>


When taking damage from a creature, I take only half and it takes the other half

This stops working on any that I attack or force to make a save, until I have a long rest
