## Features

### Rallying Cry <small>(at level 3)</small>


When I use Second Wind, I also heal three allies within 60 ft that can see or hear me



### Royal Envoy <small>(at level 7)</small>


I gain proficiency with the Persuasion skill and I gain expertise with the Persuasion skill

If already proficient, I can choose Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance



### Inspiring Surge <small>(at level 10)</small>


When I use my Action Surge, I can inspire an ally within 60 ft that can see or hear me

The ally can then use its reaction to make one melee or ranged weapon attack



### Bulwark <small>(at level 15)</small>


When I use Indomitable to reroll a Int, Wis, or Cha save, I can extend it to an ally

The ally can reroll its failed saving throw against the same effect and take the result

It only works if not incapacitated and the ally is within 60 ft and can see or hear me
