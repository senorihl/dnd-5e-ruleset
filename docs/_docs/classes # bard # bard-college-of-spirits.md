## Features

### Guiding Whispers <small>(at level 3)</small>


I learn the Guidance cantrip and can cast it with a range of 60 ft



### Spiritual Focus <small>(at level 3)</small>


[only for bard spells]

I can use a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck as a spellcasting focus



### Tales from Beyond <small>(at level 3)</small>


As a bonus action, I can expend a bardic inspiration die to roll on the Spirit Tales table

I retain the rolled tale in my mind until I bestow its effects or finish a short or long rest

I can only retain one tale at a time; I need to hold a spiritual focus to roll on the table

As an action, I can choose a creature I see in 30 ft or myself to bestow the tale's effect

The tales use my spell save DC; See the Notes page for the Spirit Tales table



### Spiritual Focus: Improve spells <small>(at level 6)</small>


While holding a spiritual focus, I can add 1d6 to one damage or healing roll of bard spells
#### Choices
- **Spiritual Focus: Improve spells**: 
   If I use a spiritual focus to cast a bard spell, I can add 1d6 to one damage or healing roll
- **Spiritual Focus: Improve spells**: 
   While holding a spiritual focus, I can add 1d6 to one damage or healing roll of bard spells






### Spirit Session <small>(at level 6)</small>


Using my spiritual focus, I can conduct a hour-long ritual to channel spirit during a rest

The number of willing participants, me included, can be up to my Proficiency Bonus

At the end, I learn a divination or necromancy spell of my choice until I start a long rest

The spell can't be higher level than the number of participants and of a level I can cast



### Mystical Connection <small>(at level 14)</small>


For Tales from Beyond, I now roll my bardic inspiration die twice and select which to use

If I roll the same number on both dice, I can instead choose any effect on the table
