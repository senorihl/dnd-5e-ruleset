# War Magic

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 59)</small>
- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 13
- **Hit dice**: d6

## Proficiencies

## Equipment


Wizard starting equipment:

- A quarterstaff -or- a dagger;
- A component pouch -or- an arcane focus;

## Features

### Arcane Deflection <small>(at level 2)</small>


As a reaction when I'm hit by an attack, I can gain +2 to my AC against that attack

As a reaction when I fail a save, I can gain +4 bonus to that saving throw

After I do either, I can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of my next turn



### Tactical Wit <small>(at level 2)</small>


I gain a bonus to my initiative rolls equal to my Intelligence modifier



### Power Surge <small>(at level 6)</small>


I have a pool of stored power surges that I can use to empower my damaging spells

I gain a power surge whenever I successfully end a spell with Dispel Magic or Counterspell

This pool can store a number of power surges equal to my Intelligence modifier (min 1)

It resets to 1 power surge after a long rest or when I have 0 surges left after a short rest

When I deal damage with a wizard spell, I can spend a power surge to do extra damage

One target takes half my wizard level in force damage; I can do this only once per turn



### Durable Magic <small>(at level 10)</small>


While I'm maintaining concentration on a spell, I gain +2 to AC and all saving throws



### Deflecting Shroud <small>(at level 14)</small>


When I use my Arcane Deflection feature, magical energy arcs from me to creatures

Up to 3 targets I can see within 60 ft of me take half my wizard level in force damage
