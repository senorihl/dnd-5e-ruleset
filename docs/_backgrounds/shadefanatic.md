## Feature: Secret Society


I have a special way of communicating with others who feel the same way I do about the Shade. When I enter a village or larger city, I can identify a contact who will give me information on those that would hinder my goals and those would help me simply because of my desire to see the Shade Enclave return in all its glory.
