## Feature: Ship's Passage


When I need to, I can secure free passage on a sailing ship for myself and my companions. I might sail on the ship I served on, or another ship I have good relations with. Because I'm calling in a favor, I can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet my every need. My companions and I are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

| 4 | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story. |
| 5 | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city. |
| 6 | I never pass up a friendly wager. |
| 7 | My language is as foul as an otyugh nest. |
| 8 | I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|

| 2 | **Fairness**: We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Freedom**: The sea is freedom― the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Mastery**: I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil) |
| 5 | **People**: I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Aspiration**: Someday I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any) |

> 
> 
> No matter where I go, people are afraid of me due to my reputation. When I am in a civilized settlement, I can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report my activity to the authorities.
