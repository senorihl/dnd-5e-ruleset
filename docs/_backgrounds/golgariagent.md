## Feature: Undercity Paths


I know hidden, underground pathways that I can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as I move through the city. I can lead a group to travel between two locations in the city twice as fast as normally. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so my journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll. |
| 2 | I like to remind people of their inevitable demise. |
| 3 | Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does. |
| 4 | I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me. |
| 5 | I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it. |
| 6 | Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action. |
| 7 | I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail. |
| 8 | Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm provokedâ€”and I'm easily provoked. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Guild**: My guild is all that really matters. (Any) |
| 2 | **Stoicism**: All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral) |
| 3 | **Nature**: The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral) |
| 4 | **Interdependence**: We are all part of nature's web. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Ambition**: The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil) |
| 6 | **Live and Let Live**: Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa. |
| 2 | I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be. |
| 3 | I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance. |
| 4 | I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission. |
| 5 | I found something in the sewer that must never come to light. |
| 6 | I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off. |
| 2 | I assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me. |
| 3 | I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground. |
| 4 | I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words. |
| 5 | I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless. |
| 6 | I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death. |
