## Feature: Secret Identity


I have created a secret identity that I use to conceal my true race and that offers a covering explanation for my presence in Hillsfar. In addition, I can forge documents, including official papers and personal letters, as long as I have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting I am trying to copy.

## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Despite its problems, I love Hillsfar, it's the greatest city in the world. The only one for me. |
| 2 | I move from place to place, never staying anywhere long and leaving nothing behind. |
| 3 | I think flattery is the best way to direct attention away from me. |
| 4 | I don't make friends easily. They're a liability I cannot afford. |
| 5 | Risk and danger are exhilarate me. Pulling off schemes and deceptions is a rush. |
| 6 | The First Lord is right, humans are superior. I really admire them, despite the atrocities. |
| 7 | I avoid people of my own race, as well as things associated with my race, lest they give me away. |
| 8 | I live for the Arena. I admire gladiators and enjoy the thrill of blood on the sands! |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Quisling**: Supporting the rulers of the land and following the laws is the road to salvation. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Scoflaw**: The laws and lawmakers are corrupt. I follow laws only when it suits me. (Chaotic)) |
| 3 | **Optimist**: Everyone Is basically good. Though the government is misguided it will all be okay. (Any) |
| 4 | **Secretive**: I am in the habit of not talking about myself. My business is none of yours. (Any) |
| 5 | **Heroic**: I do everything I can to help non-humans, regardless of the personal cost to me. (Good) |
| 6 | **Depraved**: I have lost my moral compass. The ends justify most any means. (Evil) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The humans of Hillsfar have inflicted terrible harm on me, my family, and my race. I will have revenge. |
| 2 | I am part of an underground network that smuggles non-humans into and out of the city. |
| 3 | I am a partisan. I commit minor acts of defiance against the First Lord and Red Plumes when I can. |
| 4 | I am a spy. I report on events in and around Hillfar. |
| 5 | My secret identity is the only thing protecting me from the Arena. I will stop at nothing to maintain it. |
| 6 | I am madly in love with a human who does not know my true identity, and I fear rejection if I reveal it. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | After years of denying who I am, I now despise myself and other members of my pathetic race. |
| 2 | Years of hiding have made me somewhat paranoid. I trust no one. |
| 3 | I've been lying so often and for so long that I can't help it anymore. I frequently lie for no reason at all. |
| 4 | I am ashamed. I failed to protect a member of my family who was seized and thrown into the Area. |
| 5 | I am struggling with maintaining my secret identity. I subconsciously want to get caught and therefore sometimes let my secret identity slip. |
| 6 | Years of successfully deceiving others have made me cocky. I think no one can see through my lies. |
