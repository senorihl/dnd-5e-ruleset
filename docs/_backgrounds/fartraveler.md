## Feature: All Eyes on You


My accent, mannerisms, figures of speech all mark me as foreign. Curious glances are directed my way wherever I go. A nuisance, but I also gain the friendly interest of the curious. I can parley this attention into access I might not otherwise have, for me and my companions. Nobles, scholars, merchants, and guilds, might be among the interested.
