## Feature: Guerilla


I've come to know the surrounding other natural features in which I can take refuge--or set up ambushes. I can quickly survey my environment for advantageous features. Additionally, I can scavenge around my natural surroundings to cobble together simple supplies (such as improvised torches, rope, patches of fabric, etc.) that are consumed after use.

| 6 | The knowledge in Mantor's Library is an irreplaceable treasure that must be protected. |

| d6 | Flaw |

| 2 | Ale is the only way I can escape the desperation of my circumstances. |
| 3 | It doesn't take much to get me into a fight. |
| 4 | Being an insurgent means doing things that aren't always ethical. I'm still learning to live with that. |
