## Feature: Fearsome Reputation


People recognize me as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they're careful not to draw my anger or ridicule. I can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most are too daunted by me to report my wrongdoing to the Azorius.

| 4 | I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others. |
| 5 | I enjoy testing other people's patience. |
| 6 | I can't stand it when things are predictable, so I like to add a little chaos to every situation. |
| 7 | I throw my weight around to make sure I get my way. |

| 5 | I want to be better at my chosen form of performance than any other member of my troupe. |
| 6 | I am devoted to Rakdos and live to impress him. |
