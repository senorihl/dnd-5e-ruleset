## Feature: Heart of Darkness


Those who look into my eyes can see that I have faced unimaginable horror and that I am no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear me, commoners will extend me every courtesy and do their utmost to help. Unless I have shown myself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight with me, should I find myself facing an enemy alone.
