## Suggested Characteristics


| d6 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room. |
| 2 | Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it's garbage and deserves to be destroyed. |
| 3 | I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I'm happy to quietly push them in the right direction. |
| 4 | Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over. |
| 5 | I'm beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore. |
| 6 | Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays. |
