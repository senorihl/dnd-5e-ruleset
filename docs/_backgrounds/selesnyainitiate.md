## Feature: Conclave's Shelter


My companions and I can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless I have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield me from anyone searching for me, but will not risk their lives. I can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though I must provide material components needed for spells.
