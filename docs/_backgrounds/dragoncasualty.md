## Feature: Dragonscarred


My extensive scars from being tortured by Vorgansharax give me fame and notoriety, but it is difficult to disguise my appearance and hide from prying eyes. I can use this to gain access to people and places I might not otherwise have, for me and my companions. However, I fear that my afflictions are not completely mundane, as they burn and writhe.

| 3 | Speaking of my ordeal helps sooth the still open wounds in my soul. |
| 4 | My former life is meaningless, and was ripped to shreds by the claws of Vorgansharax. All that matters now is what I do with the future. |
| 5 | I have faced the worst a dragon can deliver and survived. I am fearless, and my resolve unshakable. |
| 6 | I am haunted my tortured past, and wake at night screaming at half-remembered horrors. |

| 2 | I long to reunite with friends and family who may dwell among the Phlan Refugees, and protect them. |
