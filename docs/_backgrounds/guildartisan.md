## Suggested Characteristics


| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it― I'm a perfectionist. |
| 2 | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art. |
| 3 | I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick. |
| 4 | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion. |
| 5 | I'm rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play. |
| 6 | I like to talk at length about my profession. |
| 7 | I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible. |
| 8 | I'm well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I'm always taken aback when people haven't heard of me. |

| d6 | Ideal |
|:----------------------------|:------|
| 1 | **Community**: It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Generosity**: My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good) |
| 3 | **Freedom**: Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | **Greed**: I'm only in it for the money. (Evil) |
| 5 | **People**: I'm committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Aspiration**: I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any) |

| d6 | Bond |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me. |
| 2 | I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy. |
| 3 | I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today. |
| 4 | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love. |
| 5 | One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all. |
| 6 | I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood. |

| d6 | Flaw |
|:----------------------------|:------------------|
| 1 | I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. |
| 2 | I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me. |
| 3 | No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers. |
| 4 | I'm never satisfied with what I have― I always want more. |
| 5 | I would kill to acquire a noble title. |
| 6 | I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals. |
