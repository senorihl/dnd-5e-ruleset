  - Scroll with law text

## Feature: Legal Authority


I have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, inspiring respect and fear as a result. People mind their manners, avoid my attention, and assume I have a right to be wherever I am. My Azorius insignia gets me an audience with anyone I want, though it might work adversely with incorrigible lawbreakers. Abusing this privilege can get me in serious trouble.
