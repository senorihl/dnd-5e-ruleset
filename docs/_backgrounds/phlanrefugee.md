## Feature: Phlan Survivor


Whatever my prior standing I'm now one of the many refugees that came to Mulmaster. I'm able to find refuge with others from Phlan and those who sympathize with my plight. Within Mulmaster this means that I can find a place to sleep, recover, and hide from the watch with either other refugees from Phlan, or the Zhents within the ghettos.
