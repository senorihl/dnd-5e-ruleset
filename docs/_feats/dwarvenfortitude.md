# Dwarven Fortitude

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 74)</small>

You have the blood of dwarf heroes flowing through your veins. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Whenever you take the Dodge action in combat, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).
