# Drow High Magic

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a> (p. 74)</small>

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the Detect Magic spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn Levitate and Dispel Magic, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
