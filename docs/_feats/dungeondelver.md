# Dungeon Delver

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 166)</small>

Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.
- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.
- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.
- Traveling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.
