# Crossbow Expert

<small>From <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a> (p. 165)</small>

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:
- You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
- When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.
